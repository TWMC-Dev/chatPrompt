For the following list of D&D 5e spells, please provide a description of the casting of each spell. I want to know what they look, sound, and smell like while the caster is casting them. Write the description in the style of the author Ed Greenwood. Start by tell me you understand what i'm asking you to do for me, then ask for my list of spells.

Here are some examples:

1. **Acid Splash:** The caster's hands glow a neon green, becoming coated in a bubbling, sizzling liquid. A sharp, sour smell reminiscent of vinegar fills the air as the caster forcefully flings the luminescent bubble towards their target, which must make a **Dexterity saving throw** or take **1d6 acid damage**.
2. **Eldritch Blast:** The air hums with energy as the caster's hands crackle with an indigo lightning. A low, resonating hum sounds as the bolt of energy launches from their fingertips, **dealing 1d10 force damage** to a target and leaving a trail of ozone scent in its wake.
3. **Thorn Whip:** A rustling sound, like leaves in the wind, fills the area as the caster's arm transforms into a writhing, vine-like whip adorned with sharp thorns. The scent of fresh earth and the sweet perfume of blooming flowers accompanies this transformation as it lashes at a creature, dealing **1d6 piercing damage** and **pulling** Large or smaller creatures up to **10 feet** **closer**.
4. **Vicious Mockery:** As the caster whispers an insult, their voice echoes and reverberates, taking on a low, enchanting hum. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have **disadvantage on its next attack roll**. A bitter taste lingers in the air, as if their words were poison.
5. **Fire Bolt:** The caster's hand ignites in a controlled blaze, heat shimmering around it. The scent of charred wood hangs heavy as the small mote of flame is hurled, dealing **1d10 fire damage** to a creature or object and leaving a scorching trail and a crackling sound akin to a roaring bonfire.
6. **Frostbite:** The caster's hand cools rapidly, a thin layer of frost forming around their fingers. The temperature in the immediate vicinity drops significantly, making the air feel crisp and biting. A hushed, icy whisper resonates as the caster directs a frigid beam towards a creature within range. The targeted creature must make a **Constitution saving throw** or take **1d6 cold damage**, and have **disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll** it makes before the **end of its next turn**. A scent reminiscent of freshly fallen snow or a frozen lake hangs in the air, the chilling sound of cracking ice echoing briefly as the spell takes effect.
7. **Ray of Frost:** The temperature drops noticeably as the caster extends their arm. A low whistling sound fills the air as a beam of blue-white light streaks from their fingers, dealing **1d8 cold damage** to a creature. The scent of a frosty winter morning follows the path of the spell.
8. **Poison Spray:** The caster's hand shines a sickly yellow-green as they extend it forward, a puff of gas shooting outwards with a faint hissing noise. The target must make a **Constitution saving** **throw** or take **1d12 poison damage**. The smell is overwhelmingly acrid, like rotten eggs.
