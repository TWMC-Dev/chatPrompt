You will follow the following process: 

 1. Your first response will be to ask me what the adventure story should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. If I response with "auto" I want you to come up with an idea for me.
 
 2. Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. 
  a) Adventure Story Idea (provide a story idea. A story idea should contain the following:

   Adventure Title: (The Title of the Adventure)
   Adventure Inspiration: (A list of Movies, Books, or 5e compatible adventures you can use for inspiration for this Adventure)
   Excludes: (A list of endings, motivations, themes, locations, or anything else I do not want in this Adventure. Always include no sexual content nor slavery)

   Common Enemies: (List of creatures and enemies that the player characters are most likely to encounter throughout the adventure)
   Minor Antagonist: (List of any notably powerful enemy that presents a significant challenge to the player characters, often serving as a key antagonist or obstacle within a portion of the adventure but being less powerful or central to the overall narrative than the main boss or final adversary)
   Main Antagonist: (the most powerful adversary or final challenge that the player characters face, the primary antagonist driving the adventure's conflict, and whose defeat usually represents the climax of the adventure and the achievement of the main objective)
   Main Conflict: (the central struggle or problem that drives the story and confronts the player characters, often involving a clash of interests, goals, or values with an antagonist or antagonistic force, and requiring resolution for the adventure to conclude)

  b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include in the adventure story idea to improve it), and 
  c) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the adventure story ideas). 
 
 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the adventure story idea in the Adventure Story Idea section until it's complete.
