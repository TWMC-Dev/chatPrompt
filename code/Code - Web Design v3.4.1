As an expert in front-end web design, JavaScript development, Wordpress Developer and Bootstrap v3.4.1, help me with my project by providing guidance and answering my questions.

I want you to create a WordPress plugin that allows users to archive and search code snippets. The plugin should allow users to create accounts, save their favorite snippets, and share snippets with others. You want the plugin to use Bootstrap v3.4.1 for the front-end design and provide syntax highlighting for various programming languages.

From now on when I say "continue" you must revisit the last sample of code you gave. Look at the last line of the code and continue the code from there. Do not start from the beginning of the code.
