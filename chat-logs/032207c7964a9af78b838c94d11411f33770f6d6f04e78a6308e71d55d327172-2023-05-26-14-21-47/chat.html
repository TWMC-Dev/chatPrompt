It&#x27;s one of the few ways to revive the dead that druids have access to, which can be invaluable in a tough campaign.\n\n2. **Wall of Stone:** This spell is great for both defense and battlefield control. You can create a wall that provides cover, blocks enemy movement, or traps enemies.\n\n3. **Wrath of Nature:** This spell from Xanathar&#x27;s Guide to Everything turns the environment into a weapon, which is a fun and thematic choice for a druid. It&#x27;s especially strong in outdoor encounters.\n\n4. **Awaken:** If your campaign involves a lot of downtime or base-building, Awaken can be a great choice. It allows you to make a tree or animal into a semi-permanent ally.\n\n5. **Mass Cure Wounds:** This spell is a great choice for healing. It allows you to restore a significant amount of hit points to multiple allies at once.\n\n6. **Conjure Elemental:** This spell allows you to summon an elemental to fight for you. This can be a powerful offensive and defensive option, though it requires concentration to maintain.\n\nRemember, the &quot;best&quot; spell often depends on the situation.

You manipulate it in one of the following ways:\n\n- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn\u2019t have enough force to cause damage.\n- You can cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.\n- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you can cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.\n\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\n\nBased on this description, you can certainly use &quot;Mold Earth&quot; to dig, but there are limitations. The spell only affects a 5-foot cube of earth per casting, and the excavated earth is moved up to 5 feet away. So if you have the time and patience, you could theoretically dig a sizable hole or tunnel. \n\nHowever, there are several factors to consider. This spell only works on loose earth, not solid rock or other materials. Also, it doesn&#x27;t provide any support for the excavated area. Without proper support, a tunnel could collapse, potentially burying your character or others.

Their journey eventually led them to a long-lost city hidden within a treacherous desert, where they faced powerful guardians and claimed the final fragment of the Shattered Sigil.\n\nHaving successfully gathered all the fragments, the adventurers discovered the location of the Cult of Malathrax&#x27;s stronghold.

An ancient artifact, the Shattered Sigil, was believed to have been used by a powerful lich named Malathrax in his quest for world domination. The lich had been stopped long ago by a group of heroes, who shattered the Sigil and scattered its fragments across the Sword Coast. However, dark forces, eager to harness the power of the Shattered Sigil, have resurfaced, and the Cult of Malathrax now seeks to resurrect the lich and unleash chaos upon the realm.\n\nA scholar named Elara, who has been researching the Shattered Sigil, sought the help of a group of adventurers to locate the fragments and prevent the Cult of Malathrax from obtaining them. The adventurers began their journey in Neverwinter, gathering information about the mysterious sigil and its connection to the ancient lich Malathrax.\n\nAs they followed the trail of the Shattered Sigil, the adventurers uncovered ancient ruins, navigated treacherous dungeons, and interacted with various factions, each with their own interests in the Sigil&#x27;s fragments. Along the way, they discovered a hidden crypt in the wilderness, an ancient tower, a sunken temple beneath the Sea of Swords, and a hidden monastery in the mountains, each containing a fragment of the Shattered Sigil.\n\nWith each recovered fragment, the adventurers grew more powerful and more determined to stop the Cult of Malathrax. Their journey eventually led them to a long-lost city hidden within a treacherous desert, where they faced powerful guardians and claimed the final fragment of the Shattered Sigil.\n\nHaving successfully gathered all the fragments, the adventurers discovered the location of the Cult of Malathrax&#x27;s stronghold. They received an urgent message from an ally who had been tracking the cult, warning that the cult was preparing to perform a ritual that would unleash chaos upon the realm.\n\nWith time running out, the adventurers infiltrated the heavily guarded stronghold, where they gathered intelligence and sabotaged the cult&#x27;s operations. They explored hidden chambers, confronted dangerous creatures, and gained allies in their quest to stop the ritual.\n\nIn their final confrontation, the adventurers faced the powerful allies of the Cult of Malathrax. They overcame treacherous terrain, deadly challenges, and dangerous foes to reach the cult&#x27;s leaders. The fate of the realm hung in the balance as the heroes fought to prevent the dark ritual from succeeding.\n\nWith determination and courage, the adventurers defeated the Cult of Malathrax, stopping the ritual and saving the realm from devastation.

A group of heroes managed to stop him, shattering the Sigil and scattering its fragments across the Sword Coast.

However, after a grisly accident, the mine was abandoned, and the entrance was sealed. Years later, a group of bandits, known as the Whispering Shadows, broke the seal and took refuge in the cave. They have since transformed the cave into a hideout, using its natural defenses and their cunning traps to deter intruders.\n\n### Dungeon Overview:\n\nThe dungeon consists of five rooms connected through winding tunnels. The rooms vary in size and function, serving as guard posts, treasure storage, living quarters, and the final boss chamber. The layout of the dungeon encourages exploration, while also providing opportunities for tense combat and challenging traps.\n\n### Rooms:\n\n### 1. The Entrance\n\n&gt; As you enter the cave, a musty smell fills the air. The torchlight flickers on the damp walls, revealing a narrow tunnel that leads deeper into the bandit hideout.\n\nImportant Features: Tripwire trap, bandit guard.\n\nDM Notes: Describe the sensation of moving from the bright daylight to the dimly lit interior. Emphasize the tense atmosphere as the players progress. If the players fail to notice the tripwire trap (DC 15 Perception check), it triggers a loud alarm, alerting nearby bandits.\n\n### 2. Guard Post\n\n&gt; The tunnel widens into a small chamber, dimly lit by a flickering torch on the wall. You see a few crates, barrels, and a makeshift table with playing cards strewn across it.\n\nImportant Features: 3 bandit guards, hidden alarm button.\n\nDM Notes: The bandit guards will engage the players if the alarm was triggered in the entrance or if they are discovered. One bandit tries to press the hidden alarm button (DC 15 Perception to notice) to alert the rest of the hideout.\n\n### 3. Storage Chamber\n\n&gt; You enter a large, vaulted chamber filled with piles of stolen goods. Everything from weapons and armor to fine clothing and trinkets can be found here, evidence of the bandits&#x27; many raids.\n\nImportant Features: Treasure, hidden door (DC 20 Perception check to find).\n\nDM Notes: Allow the players to rummage through the loot, but remind them of the time pressure to eliminate the bandits. The hidden door leads to the living quarters, allowing them to bypass a trapped corridor.\n\n### 4.

They reunite with their old friend Elara, who gifts them a mysterious artifact \u2013 the Shard of Protection, a fragment of the Shattered Sigil. This Shard has a will of its own, leading them through dreams to a map hidden within the depths of the Neverwinter Museum. The party must navigate the city, decipher the Shard&#x27;s messages, and venture into the monster-infested darkness beneath the museum.\n\n## Session Recaps\n\nThis is the first session of the campaign, so there are no previous sessions to recap.\n\n## Session Read-aloud text\n\n&quot;Leaving the aftermath of the bandit attack behind, you travel the last few miles to Neverwinter. As the city gates come into view, you&#x27;re greeted by the bustling energy of one of the North&#x27;s most thriving cities. It&#x27;s a place filled with promise and peril, a perfect beginning for the adventure that lies ahead.&quot;\n\n## DM preparation\n\nDM should familiarize themselves with the city of Neverwinter using resources such as the Sword Coast Adventurer&#x27;s Guide. Prepare information on Elara and the Shard of Protection, as well as various city-dwelling NPCs and the monster types that lurk in the museum&#x27;s basement.\n\n### Encounter 1: Arrival in Neverwinter\n\n  * Encounter Type: Social,\n  * Location: Neverwinter Gates,\n  * Key NPCs: City Guards\n  * Read-aloud text: &quot;The towering gates of Neverwinter stand before you, the city guards scrutinizing each newcomer with practiced eyes.

However, dark forces, eager to harness the power of the Shattered Sigil, have resurfaced, and the Cult of Malathrax now seeks to resurrect the lich and unleash chaos upon the realm.\n\nA scholar named Elara, who has been researching the Shattered Sigil, sought the help of a group of adventurers to locate the fragments and prevent the Cult of Malathrax from obtaining them.

The Entrance\n\n&gt; As you enter the cave, a musty smell fills the air. The torchlight flickers on the damp walls, revealing a narrow tunnel that leads deeper into the bandit hideout.\n\nImportant Features: Tripwire trap, bandit guard.\n\nDM Notes: Describe the sensation of moving from the bright daylight to the dimly lit interior. Emphasize the tense atmosphere as the players progress. If the players fail to notice the tripwire trap (DC 15 Perception check), it triggers a loud alarm, alerting nearby bandits.\n\n### 2. Guard Post\n\n&gt; The tunnel widens into a small chamber, dimly lit by a flickering torch on the wall. You see a few crates, barrels, and a makeshift table with playing cards strewn across it.\n\nImportant Features: 3 bandit guards, hidden alarm button.\n\nDM Notes: The bandit guards will engage the players if the alarm was triggered in the entrance or if they are discovered. One bandit tries to press the hidden alarm button (DC 15 Perception to notice) to alert the rest of the hideout.\n\n### 3. Storage Chamber\n\n&gt; You enter a large, vaulted chamber filled with piles of stolen goods. Everything from weapons and armor to fine clothing and trinkets can be found here, evidence of the bandits&#x27; many raids.\n\nImportant Features: Treasure, hidden door (DC 20 Perception check to find).\n\nDM Notes: Allow the players to rummage through the loot, but remind them of the time pressure to eliminate the bandits. The hidden door leads to the living quarters, allowing them to bypass a trapped corridor.\n\n### 4. Living Quarters\n\n&gt; This cramped chamber is filled with crude bunk beds, a few personal belongings, and the stench of unwashed bodies. The bandits have made this space their home away from home.\n\nImportant Features: 2 sleeping bandits, information on the final room&#x27;s trap", "pub_date": null}}, {"start_ix": 1389, "end_ix": 1400, "metadata": {"title": "www.notion.so", "url": "https://www.notion.so/Session-2-Arrival-in-Neverwinter-and-the-Fragment-s-Call-36a38c667ab443a085460dc7ba4112a1", "text": "Session Overview\n\nThe adventurers, after surviving an ambush on the road, arrive in the city of Neverwinter.

A YouTube API key and the ID of a specific YouTube playlist are defined.\n\n2. It builds a URL for the YouTube API endpoint that retrieves playlist items.\n\n3. It specifies options for the API request, including the part of the playlist items to retrieve (`snippet`), the API key, the maximum number of results to return (`maxResults`), and the playlist ID.\n\n4. It calls the function `loadVids()` which makes a request to the YouTube API to retrieve the playlist items.\n\n5. When the API request is successful, the `loadVids` function logs the returned data, calls the `mainVid` function with the video ID of the first video in the playlist, and then calls `resultsLoop` with the returned data to process each video in the playlist.\n\n6. The `mainVid` function inserts an iframe into a div with the ID `video`, pointing to the YouTube URL of the video specified by the input ID. It sets various parameters such as enabling autoplay, modest branding, and controls, and disabling show info.\n\n7. The `resultsLoop` function processes each item in the returned data. For each item, it extracts the thumbnail image URL, title, the first 200 characters of the description, and the video ID. It then appends an article to a div with the class `list-inner`, containing the thumbnail image, title, and description, and sets the `data-key` attribute of the article to the video ID.\n\n8. It adds an event listener to the `list-inner` div that listens for clicks on any article. When an article is clicked, it calls the `mainVid` function with the video ID stored in the `data-key` attribute of the clicked article, thus changing the video being displayed in the `video` div to the clicked video."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2f49f-ad6f-43b3-a974-ee93ec4523c6", "children": ["aaa27cb9-1204-4333-83da-e6653aa00b6d"]}, "aaa27cb9-1204-4333-83da-e6653aa00b6d": {"id": "aaa27cb9-1204-4333-83da-e6653aa00b6d", "message": {"id": "aaa27cb9-1204-4333-83da-e6653aa00b6d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684987054.343024, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["this is the HTML that goes with the JS:\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;py-5 message-header-bg&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row no-gutters&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12 message-header&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;h3&gt;Past Messages&lt;/h3&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row no-gutters&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;py-3&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div id=&quot;list&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;div class=&quot;list-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "0f984724-4d63-4d03-8dff-d80f7170a32e", "children": ["fb066191-6332-4a81-af91-20eb110d236c"]}, "fb066191-6332-4a81-af91-20eb110d236c": {"id": "fb066191-6332-4a81-af91-20eb110d236c", "message": {"id": "fb066191-6332-4a81-af91-20eb110d236c", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684987086.896363, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The HTML you provided sets up the basic structure for the JavaScript you provided earlier. Here&#x27;s how the different pieces fit together:\n\n1. There&#x27;s a `div` with a class of `message-header-bg`, which presumably gives some sort of background or styling based on your CSS. Inside of that `div`, there are two rows: one for a heading (&quot;Past Messages&quot;) and one for an embedded video.\n\n   The `h3` heading just displays &quot;Past Messages&quot;.\n\n   The `div` with an id of `video` is where the main video is displayed. When a video is selected (either the first video on load, or when a user clicks on one), an `iframe` is added to this `div` to display the video.\n\n2. Below that, there&#x27;s another `div` with a class of `py-3` (again, this likely provides some padding or spacing based on your CSS). This contains another container with a row, and inside that row is a `div` with an id of `list`. \n\n   The `div` with the id of `list` contains another `div` with a class of `list-inner`. This is where the individual video items from the playlist are displayed. When the page loads, the JavaScript fetches the playlist data, processes each video, and adds an `article` for each video to this `div`.\n\nIn summary, this HTML sets up the basic structure of the page. The JavaScript you provided earlier then fetches and processes a YouTube playlist and uses this structure to display the videos on the page. The main video plays in the `#video` div, and the list of all videos is displayed in the `.list-inner` div."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa27cb9-1204-4333-83da-e6653aa00b6d", "children": ["aaa25670-12a6-4165-b5df-66544ce1942b", "aaa21630-4706-499d-bcfb-f2d2660912d3", "aaa2668d-62b2-44c0-8dd4-f58392651b60"]}, "aaa25670-12a6-4165-b5df-66544ce1942b": {"id": "aaa25670-12a6-4165-b5df-66544ce1942b", "message": {"id": "aaa25670-12a6-4165-b5df-66544ce1942b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684987142.94384, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Can you convert this into an PHP function?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "fb066191-6332-4a81-af91-20eb110d236c", "children": ["e52fbc6c-eb82-4bee-8d13-8e8ebcc515b8"]}, "e52fbc6c-eb82-4bee-8d13-8e8ebcc515b8": {"id": "e52fbc6c-eb82-4bee-8d13-8e8ebcc515b8", "message": {"id": "e52fbc6c-eb82-4bee-8d13-8e8ebcc515b8", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684987156.993616, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To convert this JavaScript to PHP, you need to understand that PHP is a server-side language, while JavaScript is client-side.

Add the settings fields for YouTube API key and Playlist ID to WordPress.\n2. Write a WordPress shortcode to generate the same functionality in PHP.\n\nLet&#x27;s break down the steps:\n\n**Step 1: Adding Setting Fields for YouTube API Key and Playlist ID**\n\nFirst, we will add options to the WordPress settings where you can enter your YouTube API key and Playlist ID. Add the following code to your theme&#x27;s `functions.php` file:\n\n```php\nfunction youtube_settings_init() {\n    // Register a new setting for &quot;reading&quot; section\n    register_setting(&#x27;general&#x27;, &#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;);\n    register_setting(&#x27;general&#x27;, &#x27;youtube_playlist_id&#x27;);\n\n    // Register a new section in the &quot;reading&quot; page\n    add_settings_section(\n        &#x27;youtube_settings_section&#x27;,\n        &#x27;YouTube Settings&#x27;,\n        &#x27;youtube_settings_section_callback&#x27;,\n        &#x27;general&#x27;\n    );\n\n    // Register new fields in the &quot;youtube_settings_section&quot; section, inside the &quot;reading&quot; page\n    add_settings_field(\n        &#x27;youtube_api_key_field&#x27;,\n        &#x27;YouTube API Key&#x27;,\n        &#x27;youtube_api_key_field_callback&#x27;,\n        &#x27;general&#x27;,\n        &#x27;youtube_settings_section&#x27;\n    );\n\n    add_settings_field(\n        &#x27;youtube_playlist_id_field&#x27;,\n        &#x27;YouTube Playlist ID&#x27;,\n        &#x27;youtube_playlist_id_field_callback&#x27;,\n        &#x27;general&#x27;,\n        &#x27;youtube_settings_section&#x27;\n    );\n}\n\nfunction youtube_settings_section_callback() {\n    echo &#x27;Enter your YouTube API Key and Playlist ID here.&#x27;;\n}\n\nfunction youtube_api_key_field_callback() {\n    // get the value of the setting we&#x27;ve registered with register_setting()\n    $setting = get_option(&#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;);\n    // output the field\n    echo &quot;&lt;input type=&#x27;text&#x27; name=&#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27; value=&#x27;&quot; . esc_attr($setting) . &quot;&#x27;&gt;&quot;;\n}\n\nfunction youtube_playlist_id_field_callback() {\n    $setting = get_option(&#x27;youtube_playlist_id&#x27;);\n    echo &quot;&lt;input type=&#x27;text&#x27; name=&#x27;youtube_playlist_id&#x27; value=&#x27;&quot; . esc_attr($setting) . &quot;&#x27;&gt;&quot;;\n}\n\n// add the action\nadd_action(&#x27;admin_init&#x27;, &#x27;youtube_settings_init&#x27;);\n```\n\nAfter adding this code, you should see two new fields (&quot;YouTube API Key&quot; and &quot;YouTube Playlist ID&quot;) in the General Settings page of your WordPress dashboard. You can enter your YouTube API key and Playlist ID there.\n\n**Step 2: Creating a Shortcode for YouTube Playlist Display**\n\nNext, we need to create a shortcode for embedding the playlist on a WordPress page. To do this, we will add another function to your `functions.php` file:\n\n```php\nfunction youtube_playlist_shortcode() {\n    $api_key = get_option(&#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;);\n    $playlist_id = get_option(&#x27;youtube_playlist_id&#x27;);\n\n    // Now fetch the data from YouTube API (assuming that allow_url_fopen is enabled on the server)\n    $json_url = &#x27;https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems?part=snippet&amp;maxResults=24&amp;playlistId=&#x27;.$playlist_id.&#x27;&amp;key=&#x27;.$api_key;\n    $json = file_get_contents($json_url);\n    $playlist_data = json_decode($json, true);\n\n    // Check if we have data\n    if (empty($playlist_data[&#x27;items&#x27;])) {\n        return &#x27;No videos found in the playlist.&#x27;;\n    }\n\n    // You can now loop through the videos in the playlist and create your HTML output.\n    $output = &#x27;&lt;div id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;list-inner&quot;&gt;&#x27;;\n\n    foreach($playlist_data[&#x27;items&#x27;] as $video) {\n        $vid = $video[&#x27;snippet&#x27;][&#x27;resourceId&#x27;][&#x27;videoId&#x27;];\n        $thumb = $video[&#x27;snippet&#x27;][&#x27;thumbnails&#x27;][&#x27;maxres&#x27;][&#x27;"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "max_tokens"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa21630-4706-499d-bcfb-f2d2660912d3", "children": ["f43444c1-e575-4487-86c3-64819f63eb51"]}, "f43444c1-e575-4487-86c3-64819f63eb51": {"id": "f43444c1-e575-4487-86c3-64819f63eb51", "message": {"id": "f43444c1-e575-4487-86c3-64819f63eb51", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684987389.343693, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["url&#x27;];\n        $title = $video[&#x27;snippet&#x27;][&#x27;title&#x27;];\n        $desc = substr($video[&#x27;snippet&#x27;][&#x27;description&#x27;], 0, 200);\n\n        // Add each video to the output\n        $output .= &#x27;&lt;article class=&quot;py-3&quot; data-key=&quot;&#x27;.$vid.&#x27;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#video&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x27;.$thumb.&#x27;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid img-responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pt-1 mb-1&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&#x27;.$title.&#x27;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&#x27;.$desc.&#x27;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&#x27;;\n    }\n\n    $output .= &#x27;&lt;/div&gt;&#x27;;\n\n    return $output;\n}\n\nadd_shortcode(&#x27;youtube_playlist&#x27;, &#x27;youtube_playlist_shortcode&#x27;);\n```\n\nAfter this, you can add the YouTube playlist to any post or page using the `[youtube_playlist]` shortcode.\n\nPlease note that this PHP function will only generate the HTML structure of the YouTube videos from a playlist. You still need to handle the click events to load the selected video into the main video div (`#video`). You can achieve this with jQuery or JavaScript just like your previous JavaScript code. But remember to handle JavaScript separately, in a .js file enqueued correctly in WordPress.\n\nAlso, the PHP `file_get_contents` function requires that `allow_url_fopen` be enabled on your server. If it isn&#x27;t, you could use the WordPress HTTP API (e.g., `wp_remote_get`) instead."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "ecdb7189-5579-4952-8910-3420bf076640", "children": ["aaa24cc3-9d3b-4349-9d10-060254afe4ae", "aaa2d1c7-990f-4300-8e90-136318953293"]}, "aaa24cc3-9d3b-4349-9d10-060254afe4ae": {"id": "aaa24cc3-9d3b-4349-9d10-060254afe4ae", "message": {"id": "aaa24cc3-9d3b-4349-9d10-060254afe4ae", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684987447.169742, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["mainVid"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "f43444c1-e575-4487-86c3-64819f63eb51", "children": ["0055af4b-8e9e-4a0d-914c-93ed83c0939d"]}, "0055af4b-8e9e-4a0d-914c-93ed83c0939d": {"id": "0055af4b-8e9e-4a0d-914c-93ed83c0939d", "message": {"id": "0055af4b-8e9e-4a0d-914c-93ed83c0939d", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684987482.109882, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["In the context of the JavaScript code you provided, the `mainVid(id)` function is used to display a particular video in the main viewing area.

Since this is client-side interaction, it can&#x27;t be replicated directly with PHP, which is a server-side language. \n\nHowever, we can incorporate a similar JavaScript/jQuery function within our WordPress environment to handle this client-side interaction. We will enqueue a JavaScript file where this function will reside. \n\nFirst, create a JavaScript file in your theme directory, let&#x27;s call it `youtube_playlist.js`.\n\nIn `youtube_playlist.js` file, place the following JavaScript code:\n\n```javascript\njQuery(document).ready(function($) {\n  function mainVid(id) {\n    $(&quot;#video&quot;).html(`\n      &lt;div class=&#x27;embed-container&#x27;&gt;\n        &lt;iframe src=&#x27;https://www.youtube.com/embed/${id}?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1&amp;modestbranding&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0&#x27; frameborder=&#x27;0&#x27; allowfullscreen&gt;\n        &lt;/iframe&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    `);\n  }\n\n  $(&quot;.list-inner&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, &quot;article&quot;, function() {\n    var id = $(this).attr(&quot;data-key&quot;);\n    mainVid(id);\n  });\n\n  // Load first video on page load\n  var firstVideoId = $(&quot;.list-inner article&quot;).first().attr(&quot;data-key&quot;);\n  if (firstVideoId) {\n    mainVid(firstVideoId);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis script attaches a click event to all the articles within `.list-inner`. When an article is clicked, it fetches the video id (`data-key`) from the clicked article and then calls `mainVid()` function, which replaces the `iframe` inside `#video` div with the selected video. The last lines automatically load the first video from the list on page load.\n\nNow, we have to properly enqueue this JavaScript file in WordPress. Add this to your `functions.php` file:\n\n```php\nfunction youtube_playlist_scripts() {\n    // Change &#x27;your-theme-name&#x27; to your actual theme name.\n    // If the file is not in the root of your theme folder, adjust the path accordingly.\n    wp_enqueue_script( &#x27;youtube-playlist&#x27;, get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . &#x27;/youtube_playlist.js&#x27;, array(&#x27;jquery&#x27;), &#x27;1.0.0&#x27;, true );\n}\nadd_action( &#x27;wp_enqueue_scripts&#x27;, &#x27;youtube_playlist_scripts&#x27; );\n```\n\nThis script assumes that your `.list-inner` div and `#video` div are loaded in the HTML when the page loads, so you need to ensure that your shortcode is not being loaded via AJAX or after the document is ready."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2d1c7-990f-4300-8e90-136318953293", "children": []}, "aaa2668d-62b2-44c0-8dd4-f58392651b60": {"id": "aaa2668d-62b2-44c0-8dd4-f58392651b60", "message": {"id": "aaa2668d-62b2-44c0-8dd4-f58392651b60", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684987846.62388, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Create a WordPress Plugin, I what also like to be able to add the API key and the Playlist id in the general setting in the WordPress backend?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "fb066191-6332-4a81-af91-20eb110d236c", "children": ["331575d4-2ef8-4929-9f94-e505515638dd"]}, "331575d4-2ef8-4929-9f94-e505515638dd": {"id": "331575d4-2ef8-4929-9f94-e505515638dd", "message": {"id": "331575d4-2ef8-4929-9f94-e505515638dd", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684987855.734622, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To create a WordPress plugin that allows you to add the YouTube API key and playlist ID in the general settings of the WordPress backend, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.

This function should be added to your theme&#x27;s `functions.php` file or to a custom plugin file.\n\nAlso remember to add the necessary CSS to your theme&#x27;s `style.css` file to style the output in line with the HTML and CSS from your JavaScript code.\n\nKeep in mind that WordPress has a built-in HTTP API that should be used for making HTTP requests instead of using PHP functions such as `file_get_contents()`. This is why we&#x27;re using the `wp_remote_get()` and `wp_remote_retrieve_body()` functions in the code above.\n\nThis code simply outputs the video list when you call the function `display_youtube_videos()` in a PHP file, for example in a custom page template or a custom shortcode. If you need AJAX functionality to dynamically load videos without refreshing the page, you would need to implement WordPress AJAX handlers."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2b837-5a53-4c50-884e-920d0a7fa418", "children": ["aaa252fb-7f25-4526-aa46-c3f4785bd17a"]}, "aaa252fb-7f25-4526-aa46-c3f4785bd17a": {"id": "aaa252fb-7f25-4526-aa46-c3f4785bd17a", "message": {"id": "aaa252fb-7f25-4526-aa46-c3f4785bd17a", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684984196.661652, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Make it display through a Shortcode"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "37fd9a2c-db41-453d-8fa8-765c3cc2ff1a", "children": ["d68a5dba-d23f-42e8-ad78-5bf2e8fd22a7"]}, "d68a5dba-d23f-42e8-ad78-5bf2e8fd22a7": {"id": "d68a5dba-d23f-42e8-ad78-5bf2e8fd22a7", "message": {"id": "d68a5dba-d23f-42e8-ad78-5bf2e8fd22a7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684984249.650231, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sure, to enable displaying the video list via a shortcode, you can wrap the above function within `add_shortcode`.

Here are a few steps to consider when securing API keys in WordPress:\n\n1. **Environment Variables:** Store your API key in the server environment variables. This way the key doesn&#x27;t appear in your codebase. You can access the environment variable in your PHP code like this: `$_ENV[&quot;MY_API_KEY&quot;]`.\n\n2. **WordPress Configuration file:** Store your API keys in the `wp-config.php` file which is the main configuration file for a WordPress installation. This file is not accessible from the web and provides an added layer of security. It&#x27;s important not to commit this file to version control if your project is under version control. You can define a constant in `wp-config.php`:\n\n```php\ndefine(&#x27;YOUTUBE_API_KEY&#x27;, &#x27;your-api-key&#x27;);\n```\n\nThen use this constant in your function like this: `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`.\n\n3. **Database:** Store your API key in the database, preferably encrypted. WordPress provides the Options API that you can use to save the API key in the database. To add or update an option use `update_option(&#x27;my_api_key&#x27;, &#x27;your_api_key&#x27;);` and to retrieve the option use `get_option(&#x27;my_api_key&#x27;);`. Remember, if you&#x27;re storing the API key in the database, you should also take steps to encrypt the key to add another layer of protection.\n\n4. **Use a plugin:** There are plugins available that can help manage your API keys. For example, [VaultPress](https://vaultpress.com/) is a security and backup plugin that can protect your site including API keys.\n\n5. **Permissions:** Ensure you&#x27;re only giving the API key the permissions it needs and nothing more. The principle of least privilege (PoLP) is a computer security concept in which a user is given the minimum levels of access necessary to complete his/her job functions.\n\n6. **Regenerate API keys:** Periodically regenerate your API keys to reduce the chance that older keys will be misused.\n\nLastly, always ensure your API key is not committed to your public version control system like Github, Gitlab, etc."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa21c1a-8a77-417d-8729-c3912533eb5e", "children": ["aaa2d210-3df6-4cd1-96bd-1c7e4559a311"]}, "aaa2d210-3df6-4cd1-96bd-1c7e4559a311": {"id": "aaa2d210-3df6-4cd1-96bd-1c7e4559a311", "message": {"id": "aaa2d210-3df6-4cd1-96bd-1c7e4559a311", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684984389.36101, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["what it I could add it in the backend of WordPress?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "8e2a5c50-763e-423e-8774-01fddae57045", "children": ["31fdeec4-7171-4bf8-ab17-053ad0ba46b0"]}, "31fdeec4-7171-4bf8-ab17-053ad0ba46b0": {"id": "31fdeec4-7171-4bf8-ab17-053ad0ba46b0", "message": {"id": "31fdeec4-7171-4bf8-ab17-053ad0ba46b0", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684984428.472334, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes, you can certainly add it through the WordPress backend, and it&#x27;s actually a good practice to do so. This way, you can easily change the API key if needed without touching the code.\n\nWordPress has a built-in feature called &quot;Settings API&quot; which you can use to add new settings fields in the WordPress backend. Here is how you can do it:\n\nFirst, let&#x27;s add a new settings section and a settings field in the WordPress backend:\n\n```php\n// This function registers a new settings field on the &#x27;General Settings&#x27; page of the WordPress dashboard\nfunction register_api_key_field() {\n    register_setting(&#x27;general&#x27;, &#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;, &#x27;esc_attr&#x27;);\n    add_settings_field(&#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;, &#x27;&lt;label for=&quot;youtube_api_key&quot;&gt;&#x27;.__(&#x27;YouTube API Key&#x27; , &#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27; ).&#x27;&lt;/label&gt;&#x27; , &#x27;print_youtube_api_key_field&#x27;, &#x27;general&#x27;);\n}\nadd_action(&#x27;admin_init&#x27;, &#x27;register_api_key_field&#x27;);\n\n// This function prints the input field to the &#x27;General Settings&#x27; page\nfunction print_youtube_api_key_field() {\n    $value = get_option(&#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;);\n    echo &#x27;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;youtube_api_key&quot; name=&quot;youtube_api_key&quot; value=&quot;&#x27; . $value . &#x27;&quot; /&gt;&#x27;;\n}\n```\n\nAfter you&#x27;ve added this code to your `functions.php` file, go to the &#x27;General Settings&#x27; page of your WordPress dashboard. You should see a new field labeled &#x27;YouTube API Key&#x27;. You can input your API key here.\n\nThen in your shortcode function, replace the direct API key assignment with a call to `get_option(&#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;)`. For example:\n\n```php\n$key = get_option(&#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;);\n```\n\nThis way, the API key is stored in the WordPress database and is retrievable from the backend. Be sure to save changes after updating the API key.\n\nKeep in mind that storing the key in plain text in the database (like this method does) might not be safe enough for some use cases. Encrypting the key before saving it or using other more secure methods of storage could be necessary depending on the sensitivity of the data the key provides access to."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2d210-3df6-4cd1-96bd-1c7e4559a311", "children": ["aaa2e6ab-2b13-4444-9677-6f49c36e5e70"]}, "aaa2e6ab-2b13-4444-9677-6f49c36e5e70": {"id": "aaa2e6ab-2b13-4444-9677-6f49c36e5e70", "message": {"id": "aaa2e6ab-2b13-4444-9677-6f49c36e5e70", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684984458.379714, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["provide me the final function"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "31fdeec4-7171-4bf8-ab17-053ad0ba46b0", "children": ["460c8513-9080-457f-b3a2-e2f822844c9e"]}, "460c8513-9080-457f-b3a2-e2f822844c9e": {"id": "460c8513-9080-457f-b3a2-e2f822844c9e", "message": {"id": "460c8513-9080-457f-b3a2-e2f822844c9e", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684984513.168821, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sure, here&#x27;s the final version of the function, which retrieves the API key using `get_option`:\n\n```php\nfunction display_youtube_videos($atts) {\n    ob_start(); // start buffering because we need to return the output\n\n    $key = get_option(&#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;);\n    $playlistId = &quot;PLUz0jmhAYMvalzAfj8wKNSB9Id2HlQ0ry&quot;;\n    $URL = &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems?part=snippet&amp;key=$key&amp;maxResults=24&amp;playlistId=$playlistId&quot;;\n\n    $response = wp_remote_get($URL);\n    $data = json_decode(wp_remote_retrieve_body($response));\n\n    if (!is_wp_error($data) &amp;&amp; !empty($data-&gt;items)) {\n        foreach ($data-&gt;items as $item) {\n            $thumb = $item-&gt;snippet-&gt;thumbnails-&gt;maxres-&gt;url;\n            $title = $item-&gt;snippet-&gt;title;\n            $desc = substr($item-&gt;snippet-&gt;description, 0, 200);\n            $vid = $item-&gt;snippet-&gt;resourceId-&gt;videoId;\n\n            echo &#x27;\n            &lt;article class=&quot;py-3&quot; data-key=&quot;&#x27;.$vid.&#x27;&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;\n                            &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&#x27;.$vid.&#x27;&quot;&gt;\n                                &lt;img src=&quot;&#x27;.$thumb.&#x27;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid img-responsive&quot;&gt;\n                            &lt;/a&gt;\n                        &lt;/div&gt;\n                        &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;\n                            &lt;div class=&quot;pt-1 mb-1&quot;&gt;\n                                &lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&#x27;.$title.&#x27;&lt;/div&gt;\n                                &lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&#x27;.$desc.&#x27;...&lt;/div&gt;\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\n                        &lt;/div&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/article&gt;\n            &#x27;;\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo &#x27;No videos found&#x27;;\n    }\n\n    return ob_get_clean(); // end buffering and return its contents\n}\nadd_shortcode(&#x27;youtube_videos&#x27;, &#x27;display_youtube_videos&#x27;);\n```\n\nAnd here is the settings field function, to be added to your theme&#x27;s `functions.php` file:\n\n```php\n// This function registers a new settings field on the &#x27;General Settings&#x27; page of the WordPress dashboard\nfunction register_api_key_field() {\n    register_setting(&#x27;general&#x27;, &#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;, &#x27;esc_attr&#x27;);\n    add_settings_field(&#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;, &#x27;&lt;label for=&quot;youtube_api_key&quot;&gt;&#x27;.__(&#x27;YouTube API Key&#x27; , &#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27; ).&#x27;&lt;/label&gt;&#x27; , &#x27;print_youtube_api_key_field&#x27;, &#x27;general&#x27;);\n}\nadd_action(&#x27;admin_init&#x27;, &#x27;register_api_key_field&#x27;);\n\n// This function prints the input field to the &#x27;General Settings&#x27; page\nfunction print_youtube_api_key_field() {\n    $value = get_option(&#x27;youtube_api_key&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;);\n    echo &#x27;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;youtube_api_key&quot; name=&quot;youtube_api_key&quot; value=&quot;&#x27; . $value . &#x27;&quot; /&gt;&#x27;;\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can input your YouTube API Key in the General Settings of your WordPress dashboard.

You can also include CSS styles within your plugin. This can be done by using the `wp_enqueue_style()` function which allows you to include a CSS file.\n\nFirst, create a CSS file within your plugin directory. For example, you can create a file named `styles.css` inside the `youtube-playlist-display` folder.\n\nThe content of the `styles.css` file would be:\n\n```css\nbody {\n  background-color: #000;\n}\n.message-header-bg {\n  background-color: #fff;\n  color: black;\n}\n.message-header {\n  text-align: center;\n  padding: 0 0 40px 0;\n}\n\nsection {\n  padding-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.title {\n  font-weight: 700;\n  color: white;\n}\n\n.description {\n  color: white;\n}\n.details {\n  padding: 20px;\n  font-size: 18px;\n}\n\n.embed-container {\n  position: relative;\n  padding-bottom: 56.25%;\n  height: 0;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  max-width: 100%;\n}\n\n.embed-container iframe,\n.embed-container object,\n.embed-container embed {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nNow, add a function to your plugin file to enqueue the `styles.css` file:\n\n```php\nfunction youtube_playlist_display_styles() {\n    wp_enqueue_style(&#x27;youtube-playlist-display&#x27;, plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . &#x27;styles.css&#x27;);\n}\nadd_action(&#x27;wp_enqueue_scripts&#x27;, &#x27;youtube_playlist_display_styles&#x27;);\n```\n\nThis function tells WordPress to include the `styles.css` file located within your plugin&#x27;s directory when building the site. The styles defined in this CSS file will be applied to the elements generated by your plugin. Note that the CSS will apply to the entire site, not just the elements in your plugin, so ensure your selectors are specific enough to not unintentionally style other elements."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa257db-a3b4-466b-bfde-29ff4867154e", "children": ["aaa2ea03-95fb-49de-a526-2a630e3c8f29"]}, "aaa2ea03-95fb-49de-a526-2a630e3c8f29": {"id": "aaa2ea03-95fb-49de-a526-2a630e3c8f29", "message": {"id": "aaa2ea03-95fb-49de-a526-2a630e3c8f29", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684985623.649378, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["add the bootstrap css needed to make this work without having to loag the full bootstrap css file"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "9e5ee091-3d14-4e7f-ab9a-7aa69e2508a2", "children": ["9ef0daf9-3eac-42df-8ed6-3bb074ec68b2"]}, "9ef0daf9-3eac-42df-8ed6-3bb074ec68b2": {"id": "9ef0daf9-3eac-42df-8ed6-3bb074ec68b2", "message": {"id": "9ef0daf9-3eac-42df-8ed6-3bb074ec68b2", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684985657.515754, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["If you want to include only the necessary Bootstrap styles without loading the full Bootstrap CSS file, you have a few options. However, please note that this may result in some Bootstrap components not displaying correctly, as they may rely on other Bootstrap styles. Here&#x27;s a simple method:\n\nCreate a new CSS file in your plugin directory, for example, `bootstrap-custom.css`. In this file, you can include the specific Bootstrap styles that you want to use. For instance, if you want to use Bootstrap&#x27;s `.container`, `.row`, and `.col-sm-6` classes, you could add something like this to your file:\n\n```css\n.container {\n  width: 100%;\n  padding-right: 15px;\n  padding-left: 15px;\n  margin-right: auto;\n  margin-left: auto;\n}\n\n.row {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  margin-right: -15px;\n  margin-left: -15px;\n}\n\n.col-sm-6 {\n  flex: 0 0 50%;\n  max-width: 50%;\n}\n```\n\nYou may need to include more styles depending on your specific requirements, as the above is a simplified example and doesn&#x27;t include media queries for responsiveness. You can find all Bootstrap styles in the Bootstrap GitHub repository.\n\nNext, enqueue this file in your plugin by adding the following function:\n\n```php\nfunction youtube_playlist_display_styles() {\n    wp_enqueue_style(&#x27;youtube-playlist-display&#x27;, plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . &#x27;styles.css&#x27;);\n    wp_enqueue_style(&#x27;youtube-playlist-bootstrap-custom&#x27;, plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . &#x27;bootstrap-custom.css&#x27;);\n}\nadd_action(&#x27;wp_enqueue_scripts&#x27;, &#x27;youtube_playlist_display_styles&#x27;);\n```\n\nRemember to replace `&#x27;styles.css&#x27;` and `&#x27;bootstrap-custom.css&#x27;` with the actual paths of your CSS files relative to the plugin&#x27;s root directory. Now, the styles in your `bootstrap-custom.css` file will be applied to the website.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2ea03-95fb-49de-a526-2a630e3c8f29", "children": ["aaa2afdd-1ba3-48eb-94de-517b039d21f8"]}, "aaa2afdd-1ba3-48eb-94de-517b039d21f8": {"id": "aaa2afdd-1ba3-48eb-94de-517b039d21f8", "message": {"id": "aaa2afdd-1ba3-48eb-94de-517b039d21f8", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684985906.420447, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["img-fluid img-responsive pt-1 mb-1 py-3"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "9ef0daf9-3eac-42df-8ed6-3bb074ec68b2", "children": ["33717c40-462d-4826-b9ea-c74547a38452"]}, "33717c40-462d-4826-b9ea-c74547a38452": {"id": "33717c40-462d-4826-b9ea-c74547a38452", "message": {"id": "33717c40-462d-4826-b9ea-c74547a38452", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684985931.867065, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["In your request, you&#x27;ve asked for the `img-fluid`, `img-responsive`, `pt-1`, `mb-1`, and `py-3` classes from Bootstrap. The `img-fluid` and `img-responsive` classes are for responsive images, and the `pt-1`, `mb-1`, and `py-3` classes are utility classes for padding. Here&#x27;s how you can implement these classes in your custom CSS file:\n\n```css\n/* For responsive images */\n.img-fluid, .img-responsive {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\n\n/* Padding utility classes */\n.pt-1 {\n  padding-top: 0.25rem !important;\n}\n\n.mb-1 {\n  margin-bottom: 0.25rem !important;\n}\n\n.py-3 {\n  padding-top: 1rem !important;\n  padding-bottom: 1rem !important;\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the Bootstrap uses the `!important` rule in its utility classes to ensure that these styles have higher specificity than any other potential conflicting styles. If you have other styles with higher specificity in your CSS that are conflicting with these, you may need to use the `!important` rule as well.\n\nAlso, remember that the actual padding and margin sizes depend on the root font-size. In Bootstrap 4 and 5, 1rem is equal to 16px (assuming the browser&#x27;s default root font-size hasn&#x27;t been changed). Therefore, `.25rem` equals to `4px` and `1rem` equals to `16px`.

Here&#x27;s an explanation of each class used:\n\n1. `.py-5` and `.py-3`: These are Bootstrap utility classes that add padding to the top and bottom of an element. The number represents the size of the padding. So, `py-5` adds larger padding than `py-3`.\n\n2. `.message-header-bg`: This is a custom class and seems to be used for styling the background of a header.\n\n3. `.container`: This is a Bootstrap class that sets the width of the site content and provides automatic margins to center that content on the page.\n\n4. `.row` and `.row.no-gutters`: These are Bootstrap classes used in the grid system to create horizontal groups of columns. The `.no-gutters` class removes the gutters (gaps) between columns.\n\n5. `.col-sm-12`: This is a Bootstrap class specifying that on small screens (and larger, unless otherwise specified), the column should take up all 12 columns of the available grid.\n\n6. `#video`, `#list`, and `.list-inner`: These are IDs and classes that seem to be used for JavaScript interactivity and possibly additional styling.\n\nPlease note that if you intend to use these classes, you will need to include the relevant Bootstrap CSS file or define these classes in your own CSS. In the previous responses, I have described how to do this for some of the Bootstrap classes.\n\nAs for the commented-out part, it seems to be a header with a title &quot;Past Messages&quot;.

Here are some suggestions to improve the code:\n\n1. Use a separate configuration object for API parameters:\n   Instead of defining individual variables for each API parameter, it&#x27;s better to use a separate object for configuration. This makes it easier to manage and modify the parameters.\n\n   ```javascript\n   var config = {\n     key: &quot;AIzaSyAckBTX6QUEsuSlSiyLCVNB0T8TvQ46dLA&quot;,\n     playlistId: &quot;PLgE8B1SdCTDs5AC4EJsZW-cAyyT-UaJvV&quot;,\n     URL: &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems&quot;,\n     maxResults: 24,\n     part: &quot;snippet&quot;\n   };\n   ```\n\n2. Use `const` instead of `var` for constant values:\n   The variables `key`, `playlistId`, and `URL` are constants and can be declared using `const` instead of `var` since their values don&#x27;t change.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const key = &quot;AIzaSyAckBTX6QUEsuSlSiyLCVNB0T8TvQ46dLA&quot;;\n   const playlistId = &quot;PLgE8B1SdCTDs5AC4EJsZW-cAyyT-UaJvV&quot;;\n   const URL = &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems&quot;;\n   ```\n\n3. Wrap the code inside an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):\n   Wrapping the entire code inside an IIFE helps create a separate scope and avoids polluting the global namespace.\n\n   ```javascript\n   (function () {\n     // Your code here\n   })();\n   ```\n\n4. Use `const` or `let` instead of `var`:\n   In modern JavaScript, it&#x27;s generally recommended to use `const` or `let` instead of `var` for variable declarations to improve scoping and avoid unintended issues.\n\n5. Add error handling for the AJAX request:\n   It&#x27;s important to handle errors when making API requests. You can add an error callback to the `$.getJSON` function to handle potential errors from the API request.\n\n   ```javascript\n   $.getJSON(URL, options)\n     .done(function (data) {\n       // Handle successful response\n     })\n     .fail(function (jqxhr, textStatus, error) {\n       // Handle error\n     });\n   ```\n\n6. Consider using template literals for HTML generation:\n   Instead of concatenating strings, you can use template literals for cleaner and more readable HTML generation.\n\n   ```javascript\n   $(&quot;.list-inner&quot;).append(`\n     &lt;article class=&quot;py-3&quot; data-key=&quot;${vid}&quot;&gt;\n       &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n         &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\n           &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;\n             &lt;a href=&quot;#video&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;${thumb}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid img-responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n           &lt;/div&gt;\n           &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;\n             &lt;div class=&quot;pt-1 mb-1&quot;&gt;\n               &lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;${title}&lt;/div&gt;\n               &lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;${desc}...&lt;/div&gt;\n             &lt;/div&gt;\n           &lt;/div&gt;\n         &lt;/div&gt;\n       &lt;/div&gt;\n     &lt;/article&gt;\n   `);\n   ```\n\n7. Consider using event delegation for click events:\n   Instead of attaching click event handlers to each `article` element individually, you can use event delegation by attaching the click handler to the parent element.

This can help with heart health and lower the risk of developing chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain types of cancer.\n\nCommon Health Concerns: \nGiven your weight, body fat percentage, and food preferences, you might be at risk of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and certain digestive issues.\n\nFoods and Drinks to Avoid:\nGiven your goals and health concerns, you should minimize the intake of processed foods and fast food. Limit your consumption of high sodium, high sugar, and high saturated fat items such as pizza, burgers, and other fast-food options from places like Taco Bell. Excessive sugar from drinks like the Smoothie King Chocolate Gladiator should be avoided or kept to a minimum as well.\n\nDiet Programs: \nConsidering your preferences and lifestyle, a combination of a Mediterranean diet and a balanced, calorie-controlled diet would be beneficial. The Mediterranean diet is heart-healthy and rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like fish. This coupled with balanced meals that control your portion sizes can aid in your weight loss goals.\n\nDiet Recommendations:\nIncrease your daily water intake to at least 8 glasses a day. Hydration aids in digestion and can help control your appetite. \nEnsure a balanced diet, high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Incorporate a variety of fruits, lean proteins (chicken, fish), and complex carbohydrates (brown rice, whole wheat bread) in your diet. \n\nMeal Plan: \nAs you prefer 3 meals and 3 snacks per day, here&#x27;s a suggestion:\n\n- Breakfast: Smoothie with protein powder (vanilla or chocolate), a banana, and a spoon of peanut butter.\n- Mid-Morning Snack: Greek yogurt with almonds.\n- Lunch: Grilled chicken or fish tacos with a side of mixed beans.\n- Afternoon Snack: An apple with a small serving of cheese.\n- Dinner: Baked salmon with a side of sweet potato and corn.\n- Evening Snack: Protein shake (like Ensure Max Protein Nutritional Shake).\n\nEach meal should contain a protein source, a carbohydrate source, and a fruit or vegetable. Keep portion sizes moderate to help control your calorie intake.\n\nExercise: \nWalking 4000 to 6000 steps per day is a good start, but you may want to gradually increase your physical activity. Consider including strength training or resistance workouts 2-3 times a week, along with aerobic exercises such as brisk walking, jogging, or cycling for overall health and weight management.\n\nRemember to always consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise regimen.

Let&#x27;s start with a health analysis based on your details:\n\nAt 6&#x27;2&quot; and 283 lbs, your BMI (Body Mass Index) is 36.3, which is classified as Obese (Class II) according to the World Health Organization standards. You also have a high body fat percentage (40%). The healthy range for men is generally between 6-24%. These figures, coupled with your preference for less active physical exercise (4,000 - 6,000 steps per day), signify that there&#x27;s a significant risk for health issues like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.\n\nYour sleep duration, from 12:30 am until about 7:00 am daily, totals 6.5 hours. It&#x27;s slightly less than the 7-9 hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation for adults.\n\nYou&#x27;ve indicated a low water intake, with 2-4 glasses a day. It&#x27;s important to aim for a minimum of eight 8-ounce glasses (around 2 liters, or half a gallon) of water per day, as recommended by health authorities.\n\nYour main health concerns (heart health, gut health, balanced diet, vitamins, minerals, and fiber) and your goal of losing weight align with the need to make significant lifestyle changes. Heart health can be improved with a balanced diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and managing stress levels.\n\nGiven your food preferences, allergies, and time available for cooking, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Meal Plan &amp; Dietary Recommendations**: Aim for balanced meals with lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and fiber. Incorporate nuts and beans that you like into your meals, and add more diversity to your vegetable intake.\n\n2. **Meal Replacement Shakes**: Meal replacement shakes can be a good option when you&#x27;re pressed for time. Ensure the ones you choose are high in protein and low in sugar, and remember they shouldn&#x27;t replace all your meals, as whole foods provide essential nutrients.\n\n3. **Cooking**: You&#x27;ve indicated that you&#x27;re open to spending 20-30 minutes on meal preparation each day. This is a great habit to maintain. Cooking at home allows you to control the ingredients and portion sizes. \n\n4. **Pre-Packaged Meals and Takeout**: While convenient, they can be high in sodium and unhealthy fats. Look for healthier options when ordering out, like grilled chicken tacos instead of fried or beef ones.\n\n5. **Vitamin Supplements**: Since you&#x27;re avoiding some nutrient-rich foods, consider a multivitamin supplement to ensure you&#x27;re getting a full range of essential vitamins and minerals. It&#x27;s always best to consult a healthcare provider before starting any supplements.\n\nHere&#x27;s a sample meal plan based on your preferences and restrictions:\n\n**Breakfast**:\n- Option 1: High Protein Shake with a serving of fruit (preferably banana)\n- Option 2: Scrambled eggs with a slice of whole grain bread \n\n**Mid-Morning Snack**:\n- Option 1: Handful of almonds or peanuts \n- Option 2: Greek yogurt with honey\n\n**Lunch**:\n- Option 1: Grilled chicken salad (with allowed vegetables and dressing)\n- Option 2: Turkey or tuna sandwich on whole grain bread with a side of raw carrots\n\n**Afternoon Snack**:\n- Option 1: An apple with peanut butter \n- Option 2: Cheese stick \n\n**Dinner**:\n- Option 1: Grilled salmon with a side of mashed potatoes \n- Option 2: Stir-fry with chicken, brown rice, and veggies \n\n**Evening Snack**:\n- Option 1: High Protein Nutritional Shake (like Ensure Max)\n- Option 2:"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "max_tokens"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2994b-1a24-4314-86e0-c23db99421c6", "children": ["b44a19d0-fbfc-4341-bf25-e5a6792b1602"]}, "b44a19d0-fbfc-4341-bf25-e5a6792b1602": {"id": "b44a19d0-fbfc-4341-bf25-e5a6792b1602", "message": {"id": "b44a19d0-fbfc-4341-bf25-e5a6792b1602", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684731957.142949, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [" A serving of sweet corn\n\nLastly, please remember to consult with a healthcare provider before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine.

Based on your data, it seems that you are looking for a balanced diet that takes into account your preferences and health goals.\n\nFirstly, it&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re looking to make some positive changes to your lifestyle and diet. Losing weight and improving your overall health are commendable goals. Here&#x27;s a broad approach to meet your health goals:\n\n1. **Increasing Physical Activity**: You are currently walking an average of 4000 to 6000 steps a day. Try to gradually increase this to 8000-10000 steps a day. Any additional physical activity that you enjoy, such as swimming, biking, or strength training, would be beneficial.\n\n2. **Sleep**: You&#x27;re getting about 6.5 hours of sleep per night, which is a bit less than the recommended 7-9 hours for adults. If you can, try to extend your sleeping hours for better recovery and health.\n\n3. **Water**: Try to increase your water intake to at least 8-10 glasses per day. This can help with weight loss and maintaining overall health.\n\n4. **Balanced Diet**: It is essential to eat a balanced diet for weight loss and overall health. Your diet should include a good mix of protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates. \n\n5. **Meal Replacement Shakes**: Since you&#x27;re open to meal replacement shakes, these can be a good way to ensure you&#x27;re getting necessary nutrients. They can be especially useful for breakfast if you&#x27;re short on time.\n\n6. **Vitamin Supplements**: Consider a multivitamin supplement since you are avoiding certain nutrient-rich foods. It&#x27;s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen, though.\n\nNow, let&#x27;s move on to a meal plan tailored for you:\n\n**Breakfast**:\n\n- Ensure Max Protein Nutritional Shake with a serving of fruit like an apple or a banana.\n\n**Mid-Morning Snack**:\n\n- Greek yogurt with almonds or pecans.\n\n**Lunch**:\n\n- Grilled chicken tacos with whole grain tortillas and a side of brown rice.\n- Turkey and cheese sandwich on whole grain bread with a side of fruit.\n\n**Afternoon Snack**:\n\n- Smoothie King Chocolate Gladiator with Banana and peanut butter smoothies (moderate serving size)\n\n**Dinner**:\n\n- Grilled salmon or another fish of your choice with a side of brown rice and a mixed bean salad.\n- Lean pork or lamb stir fry with whole grain noodles and mixed bell peppers.\n\n**Evening Snack**:\n\n- A small bowl of popcorn or sunflower seeds.\n\nThis meal plan provides a balance of macronutrients and is in line with your food preferences. It&#x27;s also designed to be heart-healthy, rich in fiber, and support gut health.\n\nAs for vitamins, minerals, and fiber, many foods in your preferred list are already rich in these. Chicken, fish, and eggs are great sources of vitamins B12 and D. Beans are excellent for fiber and minerals like iron. Almonds, peanuts, and pecans are rich in healthy fats, fiber, and various vitamins. The fruits you eat can help to provide a good range of vitamins, particularly vitamin C.\n\nPlease note that while the meal plan is designed to be balanced and nutritious, it&#x27;s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider before making significant changes to your diet, especially given your goals and current weight."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa23a3a-c0e9-4147-a2af-5e077816147d", "children": []}, "aaa2c617-535f-43ce-8e1b-ba0b28c8620d": {"id": "aaa2c617-535f-43ce-8e1b-ba0b28c8620d", "message": {"id": "aaa2c617-535f-43ce-8e1b-ba0b28c8620d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684730984.828442, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["As a knowledgeable nutritionist and health expert, you are well-versed in all diet plans.

I\u2019ll tailor this plan to address your main health concerns and help you meet your goal of losing 40 lbs. Let&#x27;s start with some general health and diet recommendations based on the information you provided.\n\n1. **Increase Water Intake:** Aim to drink at least 2 liters or around 8 glasses of water per day. Keeping well-hydrated is crucial for overall health, including heart health and gut health.\n\n2. **Increase Physical Activity:** While your daily walking is excellent, incorporating more physical activity could help you reach your weight loss goal more quickly. Consider strength training exercises to build muscle and further support weight loss. \n\n3. **Get Enough Sleep:** Try to aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night, which means adjusting your sleep schedule if possible. Lack of sleep can impact your hunger hormones and make weight loss more difficult.\n\n4. **Gradually Include Vegetables:** I understand you avoid all vegetables currently, but they&#x27;re an essential source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Start small by incorporating vegetables into meals where they&#x27;re not the main feature (e.g., in a pasta sauce or stew).\n\n5. **Portion Control:** Be mindful of your portion sizes, especially when consuming higher calorie foods or dining out.\n\n6. **Fiber and Probiotics:** Since you&#x27;re interested in gut health, consider adding a probiotic supplement or foods rich in probiotics like yogurt. \n\n7. **Balanced Diet:** Make sure to include lean proteins, healthy fats, and carbohydrates from whole grains in your meals. This will provide a balance of nutrients and keep you satiated.\n\n**Meal Plan**\n\n**Breakfast:**\n\n* Protein Smoothie: Blend 1 cup almond milk, 1 ripe banana, 1 tbsp of natural peanut butter, 1 scoop of chocolate protein powder (preferably low sugar).\n\n**Morning Snack:**\n\n* Greek yogurt (plain) with a sprinkle of sunflower seeds and a drizzle of honey.\n\n**Lunch:**\n\n* Grilled Chicken Tacos: Use whole-grain tortillas, grilled chicken breast, a sprinkle of cheese, salsa. You can add some beans to increase fiber.\n\n**Afternoon Snack:**\n\n* A handful of almonds or peanuts.\n\n**Dinner:**\n\n* Baked fish with lemon, served with brown rice and steamed broccoli (if you feel comfortable trying it).\n\n**Evening Snack:**\n\n* If you feel hungry, you can have another protein shake, the Ensure Max Protein Nutritional Shake you like.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point. Adjust portion sizes and food choices based on how you feel and whether you&#x27;re making progress towards your weight loss goal. It&#x27;s essential to consult with a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional for a personalized plan, especially considering your heart health concerns. This plan is also missing some nutrient-dense vegetables, which you currently avoid.

This indicates that you are currently in the obese category according to the BMI classification. It&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re seeking to make changes to your lifestyle and diet, as a healthier lifestyle can help mitigate risks associated with obesity, such as heart disease and diabetes.\n\nYour main health concerns are related to heart health, gut health, a balanced diet, and adequate intake of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. These goals are well aligned with your objective of losing 40 lbs.\n\nFirst, I would recommend increasing your water intake to at least 8 glasses (or 2 liters) a day. Adequate hydration is essential for all bodily functions and can also help with appetite regulation. \n\nSince you&#x27;re open to vitamin supplements, it would be a good idea to take a daily multivitamin to ensure you are getting all the necessary nutrients, especially since you don&#x27;t consume any vegetables. However, I would recommend considering blending vegetables into smoothies or incorporating them into soups or stews where their taste might be less pronounced. \n\nSleep is another crucial part of maintaining good health. Although your current sleep schedule isn&#x27;t unhealthy, you might benefit from trying to add an additional half hour or so of sleep, aiming for a full 8 hours when possible. \n\nExercise is another vital part of weight loss and overall health. If possible, consider adding some more intensive exercise into your routine, even if it&#x27;s just a couple of times per week. This could include things like swimming, cycling, or weight training.\n\nRegarding your diet, it&#x27;s essential to create a calorie deficit for weight loss. Given your physical activity level, you should aim for a diet of about 2000-2200 calories per day to promote weight loss at a safe rate. This diet should be high in protein to support muscle maintenance, and include moderate amounts of fats and controlled amounts of carbohydrates.\n\nSample Meal Plan:\n\nBreakfast:\n- Smoothie with 1 cup of almond milk, 1 scoop of chocolate protein powder, 1 banana, and 1 tbsp of peanut butter\n\nSnack:\n- Greek yogurt with a handful of almonds\n\nLunch:\n- Grilled chicken tacos with whole grain tortillas, and a side of black beans\n\nSnack:\n- Ensure Max Protein Nutritional Shake\n\nDinner:\n- Baked fish with a side of brown rice, topped with a homemade tomato sauce\n\nSnack:\n- Small portion of fruit (e.g., an apple or orange)\n\nThis plan is designed to help you control your caloric intake while still being enjoyable and satiating. The protein shake and Greek yogurt provide added protein which can help keep you feeling full, and the whole grains in the tortillas and brown rice provide much-needed fiber.\n\nPlease remember that every person is unique and that this advice is general in nature. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any diet or exercise regimen. They can provide personalized advice that takes into account your full medical history and current state of health."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa22c36-9cf7-4a15-b6af-c0b6eb06a1bc", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "9acf55b8-31b0-459e-bcd3-a319cfa5dd39", "plugin_ids": null, "id": "ee11f9d7-7d37-46bd-af94-81374c015de6"}, {"title": "Meal Plan Recommendations", "create_time": 1684729594.153265, "update_time": 1684729675.0, "mapping": {"ce827eb0-f12d-4764-bca2-9e1e6a77d811": {"id": "ce827eb0-f12d-4764-bca2-9e1e6a77d811", "message": {"id": "ce827eb0-f12d-4764-bca2-9e1e6a77d811", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684729594.153577, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa1494e-52d6-481a-ac44-32a72fb7be13", "children": ["aaa2619d-0e36-4b43-8d63-7541d214ce92"]}, "aaa1494e-52d6-481a-ac44-32a72fb7be13": {"id": "aaa1494e-52d6-481a-ac44-32a72fb7be13", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["ce827eb0-f12d-4764-bca2-9e1e6a77d811"]}, "aaa2619d-0e36-4b43-8d63-7541d214ce92": {"id": "aaa2619d-0e36-4b43-8d63-7541d214ce92", "message": {"id": "aaa2619d-0e36-4b43-8d63-7541d214ce92", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684729594.156114, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["As an AI trained in nutrition and health, I&#x27;d like you to function as my personal nutritionist and health expert.

Here&#x27;s a general outline:\n\n1. **Caloric Intake**: To lose weight, you&#x27;ll need to consume fewer calories than you burn. The exact amount will depend on a variety of factors, but a common starting point is to reduce your current intake by 500 to 1000 calories per day, aiming for a weight loss of 1-2 lbs per week. This is generally seen as a healthy and sustainable rate of weight loss.\n\n2. **Physical Activity**: Try to increase your daily step count gradually, aiming for a goal of 10,000 steps per day. Also, consider incorporating strength training into your routine 2-3 times per week, which can help increase your metabolism and promote weight loss.\n\n3. **Hydration**: Aim for at least 8 glasses of water per day. Proper hydration is important for overall health and can help with weight loss by promoting feelings of fullness.\n\n4. **Sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. If possible, try to adjust your sleep schedule so you&#x27;re going to bed earlier and waking up earlier. Quality sleep is important for overall health and can impact weight loss.\n\n5. **Meal Schedule**: Stick to your 3 meals and 3 snacks per day, but be mindful of portion sizes and the balance of nutrients in each meal or snack. Here&#x27;s a general plan:\n\n   - **Breakfast**: Go for protein-rich meals, such as Greek yogurt with a sprinkle of almonds and some fresh fruit, or a protein shake made with a plant-based protein powder, mixed berries, and almond milk.\n   - **Mid-morning Snack**: Try a small portion of roasted peanuts or an apple.\n   - **Lunch**: Opt for lean protein (like grilled chicken or fish) with a side of whole grains (like brown rice or whole grain bread) and some colorful veggies.\n   - **Afternoon Snack**: Have a protein bar or a serving of Greek yogurt.\n   - **Dinner**: Again, aim for a balance of lean protein, whole grains, and veggies. Try different cooking methods (like grilling or steaming) and spices to keep things interesting.\n   - **Evening Snack**: A protein shake could be a good option here.\n\n6. **Alternative Nutrient Sources**: You mentioned a number of foods you&#x27;d like to avoid, many of which are high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Here are some alternative sources:\n\n   - **Vegetables**: If you&#x27;re not a fan of vegetables in general, try incorporating them into smoothies or sauces where their flavor can be masked. Many fruits, whole grains, and legumes also contain significant amounts of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n   - **Quinoa**: Other whole grains like brown rice, oatmeal, or whole grain bread can provide similar benefits.\n   - **Hard-boiled Eggs**: If it&#x27;s the preparation method you dislike, try other ways of cooking eggs, like scrambled or poached. Other sources of protein include lean meats, dairy, and legumes.\n   - **Avocados**: For healthy fats, try olives, olive oil, or fatty fish like salmon. If it&#x27;s the texture you don&#x27;t like, blending these foods into a smoothie can help.\n   - **Nuts and Seeds**: You mentioned a few specific nuts and seeds you&#x27;d like to avoid, but others (like the almonds and sunflower seeds you do like) can provide similar nutritional benefits.\n\nRemember, it&#x27;s important to make these changes gradually and seek professional medical advice before starting any new diet or exercise regimen. This plan is a general guideline and may need to be adjusted based on your progress and how you"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "max_tokens"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2619d-0e36-4b43-8d63-7541d214ce92", "children": ["b830dd5e-efb3-4da7-897b-4c4840948390"]}, "b830dd5e-efb3-4da7-897b-4c4840948390": {"id": "b830dd5e-efb3-4da7-897b-4c4840948390", "message": {"id": "b830dd5e-efb3-4da7-897b-4c4840948390", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684729673.326955, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "# I&#x27;ll search for some easy and healthy recipes that align with the dietary preferences and restrictions provided.\r\nsearch(&quot;easy healthy recipes under 30 minutes&quot;)"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|im_end|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "browser"}, "parent": "2c93987b-c8d2-4ce9-86e1-1f39ab2e202c", "children": ["c44c4ab3-7372-49f2-95ff-824b017af636"]}, "c44c4ab3-7372-49f2-95ff-824b017af636": {"id": "c44c4ab3-7372-49f2-95ff-824b017af636", "message": {"id": "c44c4ab3-7372-49f2-95ff-824b017af636", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684729673.32719, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_browsing_display", "result": "# \u30100\u202052 Healthy Dinner Recipes Ready in 30 Minutes | Taste of Home\u2020www.tasteofhome.com\u3011\nShrimp with Warm German-Style Coleslaw.

I have a good sense of your current lifestyle and nutritional habits, and will make sure to tailor a plan that fits your specific needs. \n\nFirstly, it is great that you are taking steps towards a healthier lifestyle. It&#x27;s important to remember that losing weight is not just about diet but also about increasing physical activity and improving overall lifestyle habits. \n\nGiven your current weight, height, age, and activity level, I would estimate your daily caloric needs to maintain your current weight at around 2,800 - 3,000 calories per day. To lose weight in a healthy and sustainable manner, a reduction of 500 - 1,000 calories per day can lead to a weight loss of 1 - 2 pounds per week. This would mean targeting an intake of around 1,800 - 2,500 calories per day. However, it&#x27;s important not to drastically cut your calories too much, as this could lead to nutrient deficiencies and make it hard to stick to the plan long-term. \n\nAs for your dietary preferences, I see that you&#x27;re not a fan of vegetables, quinoa, hard-boiled eggs, or avocado. However, you are open to other ways to get those essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re open to cooking meals at home and are open to meal replacement shakes. \n\nNow, here are some initial suggestions:\n\n**1. Increase your water intake.** You&#x27;re currently consuming 2-4 glasses of water a day, which is less than the recommended 8-10 glasses. Increasing your water intake can aid in weight loss by helping you feel fuller and reducing overeating.\n\n**2. Incorporate more fruits and whole grains into your diet.** Since you&#x27;re not a fan of vegetables, fruits can be another excellent source of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Similarly, whole grains can provide the fiber that you would otherwise get from vegetables and quinoa. \n\n**3. Lean proteins and healthy fats.** Aim for lean proteins such as chicken, turkey, fish, or plant-based proteins like tofu or lentils. Healthy fats from sources like nuts and seeds can replace avocado.\n\n**4. Limit takeout and pre-packaged meals.** These often contain high levels of sodium and unhealthy fats. Opt for homemade versions of your favorite takeout meals instead, so you can control the ingredients and portion sizes.\n\n**5. Consider meal replacement shakes.** Since you&#x27;re open to these, they can be a convenient and quick way to ensure you&#x27;re getting a balance of nutrients. However, it&#x27;s important to ensure they are low in added sugars and high in protein and fiber.\n\nNext, to build a more detailed meal plan, I will need to know if there are any specific dietary restrictions or allergies that you have. Also, knowing your food dislikes and preferences can help to tailor the meal plan to your tastes. For example, what fruits, whole grains, proteins, and fats you enjoy."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2555c-9ace-4946-8ca4-74dbbbac2cdd", "children": ["aaa20d6c-5fe1-4716-8391-d5023a6ff0e2"]}, "aaa20d6c-5fe1-4716-8391-d5023a6ff0e2": {"id": "aaa20d6c-5fe1-4716-8391-d5023a6ff0e2", "message": {"id": "aaa20d6c-5fe1-4716-8391-d5023a6ff0e2", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684727009.830876, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Dietary restrictions or allergies: none"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "bc412820-3970-44e1-9499-4d9883cb41db", "children": ["d201201d-b246-4f58-b54e-6052cb48ca00"]}, "d201201d-b246-4f58-b54e-6052cb48ca00": {"id": "d201201d-b246-4f58-b54e-6052cb48ca00", "message": {"id": "d201201d-b246-4f58-b54e-6052cb48ca00", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684727037.425876, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["That&#x27;s great to hear. Now, here&#x27;s a simple meal plan suggestion for a day based on your preferences. Remember, the goal is to create a balanced, nutrient-dense meal plan that helps you feel satisfied while also helping you reach your weight loss goals.\n\n**Breakfast:**\n- Smoothie King Chocolate Gladiator Smoothie with Banana and Peanut Butter (you already enjoy this, and it&#x27;s a good source of protein and healthy fats)\n\n**Morning Snack:**\n- Apple with a small handful of nuts (this will provide you with fiber, vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats)\n\n**Lunch:**\n- Grilled chicken breast with a side of brown rice and salsa (for a Mexican twist, since you enjoy Mexican food)\n\n**Afternoon Snack:**\n- Greek yogurt with a handful of mixed berries (another source of protein, plus antioxidants from the berries)\n\n**Dinner:**\n- Healthy homemade pizza: whole grain flatbread, low-sodium tomato sauce, low-fat mozzarella, and your favorite lean protein like grilled chicken or turkey. You could add a few veggies if you&#x27;re feeling adventurous, like bell peppers or spinach.\n\n**Evening Snack:**\n- Ensure Max Protein Nutritional Shake with 30g of Protein (a convenient and quick way to get some extra protein)\n\nRemember, portion control is key. It&#x27;s not just about what you eat, but also how much. For example, while nuts are very healthy, they are also high in calories, so it&#x27;s important to stick to a small handful.\n\nThis is just a one-day example. I would suggest mixing it up every few days to ensure you&#x27;re getting a variety of nutrients and to prevent getting bored with your meals. \n\nFinally, remember to gradually increase your physical activity. Walking is a great start, but as you get more comfortable, try to incorporate other forms of exercise such as weightlifting, swimming, or cycling. These activities can help boost your metabolism and aid in weight loss.\n\nLet me know if there&#x27;s anything you&#x27;d like to change or if you have any specific recipes or meal prep instructions you need!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa20d6c-5fe1-4716-8391-d5023a6ff0e2", "children": ["aaa23f8f-c00f-4905-b189-e873824b0914", "aaa2782b-29e5-49c7-a0af-baf4140ed042"]}, "aaa23f8f-c00f-4905-b189-e873824b0914": {"id": "aaa23f8f-c00f-4905-b189-e873824b0914", "message": {"id": "aaa23f8f-c00f-4905-b189-e873824b0914", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684727446.843111, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Provide 6 additional options for each meal.

But while the noodle dishes are tempting, a better bet for your health is to go for the red curry with chicken. At American Thai take-out restaurants, red curries tend to have more vegetables than green curries, says Nicole Swingle, RD. \u201cI also opt for brown steamed rice on the side and sometimes ask for them to please swap more vegetables into the curry. I also get the chicken satay for extra protein, and sometimes I\u2019ll also order the green papaya salad to share as an appetizer, too.\u201d\n\nAnother good choice is the cashew chicken stir fry with brown rice. This is a great option because it\u2019s a very balanced meal, and the sauce is generally pretty light. \u201cIt is high in lean protein from the chicken, offers some healthy fats from the cashews, and lots of high fiber and nutrient rice veggies are added to the stir fry. I like it with brown rice for extra fiber,\u201d says Kelsey Butler, RD.\n\n## Pizza\n\nFor pizza lovers, it can be difficult to enjoy your favorite food while also maintaining your health goals. But with some simple modifications, you can still enjoy your pizza take out without sacrificing flavor or nutrition. \u201cWe start by modifying the crust \u2014 either opt for a thin crust or a gluten free crust. Thin crust cuts down on calories, while a gluten free crust cuts down on inflammatory ingredients,\u201d says \u301012\u2020Trista Best\u2020balanceone.com\u3011, RD. \u201cNext, consider the toppings. Choose vegetables over fatty meats.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep serving size in mind, too. \u201cCut yourself smaller pieces,\u201d says Best. \u201cThe most important thing when eating any food is to honor your true fullness. This means that when you start to feel yourself getting full, stop eating and just enjoy the company you\u2019re in.\u201d Remember also that pizza can be part of a meal instead of the whole meal. Most local pizza places will also deliver a large Greek salad (ask for the dressing on the side so you can add only as much as you want), as well as healthy sides like saut\u00e9ed broccoli rabe. \n\n[Image: Indian food spread on the table \u2014 a delicious feast]\n\n## Indian\n\nThere\u2019s so much to love about Indian takeout, from naan to raita. But like a lot of restaurant food, it can have a lot of hidden fat and sodium. One of the best orders at an Indian take-out restaurant: the chicken jalfrezi curry. \u201cThis dish is made with bell peppers and onion, so it\u2019s well balanced with protein-rich chicken,\u201d says Butler. \u201cThe sauce is also broth-based, so there isn\u2019t as much saturated fat, unlike some of the creamier sauces. I pair this curry with brown rice to balance the meal with carbs and add more fiber.\u201d\n\n## Sushi\n\nSushi always feels like a healthy option, and it absolutely can be. But what you order really does matter. Instead of opting for a deep-fried roll (think anything with the words \u201ccrunch\u201d or \u201ctempura\u201d in the description), or Americanized rolls drizzled in spicy mayo, consider simpler dishes. One great meal, according to Mia Syn, MS, RDN, is a salmon avocado roll, sashimi, a side of steamed brown rice, and edamame. \n\n\u201cSalmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for brain and heart health, while avocado is a source of plant-based fats that can help enhance the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, K, and E,\u201d Syn says. \u201cBrown rice is a whole grain filled with fiber, which is important for digestive health and also helps you feel full longer. And edamame is a source of complete plant-based protein.\u201d\n\n## Chinese\n\nAmericanized Chinese takeout is simply delicious, but if you\u2019re ordering classics like sesame chicken and egg rolls, it can also be filled with sodium, sugar, and partially hydrogenated oils. \u201cStart your meal with steamed dumplings, hot and sour soup, or egg drop soup instead of egg rolls,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cAvoid battered and deep fried entrees such as General Tso\u2019s chicken and instead choose stir fried dishes such as shrimp or beef and broccoli, moo goo gai pan, or skewered proteins.\u201d Opt for sides of vegetable dishes, like eggplant with garlic sauce and garlic green beans. If you want a really healthy option, choose from the steamed menu, which is usually served with a side of your preferred dipping sauce. You can opt for a protein like tofu, chicken, or shrimp steamed with mixed vegetables, and then just dip each bite into the sauce on the side.\n\n## Mexican\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a healthy, plant-based option with fewer refined carbs, opt for a burrito bowl instead of a burrito.\n\n\u201cChoose a base of brown rice and beans for protein, and top it with fajita vegetables, salsa, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole,\u201d says vegan dietitian \u301013\u2020Stephanie Wells\u2020www.thymetogovegannutritionservices.com\u3011, MS, RD, ACSM-CPT. Some restaurants have started offering additional plant-based protein options made with tofu or pea protein, for example, which can be a great addition if you need a high-protein meal and don\u2019t eat meat. \u201cI love ordering this type of meal because it is quick, convenient, and balanced with all of the food groups important for a vegan or plant-based diet,\u201d says Wells.\n\nIt\u2019s the customization option that makes burrito bowls such a great option, but that works for fajitas, too. \u201cBoth bowls and fajitas are customizable options, which means you can control the protein, veggies, and starches added,\u201d says Butler. \u201cFor both, I go with a lean protein like chicken, fish, shrimp, or black beans. I then choose a fiber-rich carb like brown rice, black rice, or corn tortillas.\u201d\n\n## Burgers \n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a big, juicy burger with all the toppings. \u201cTo enhance the flavor and avoid processed flour, high fructose corn syrup, and additives, try ordering a burger without the bun,\u201d says \u301014\u2020Alyssa Wilson\u2020www.signos.com\u3011, RD. \n\nMost restaurants now have the option of choosing to turn your burger into a lettuce wrap instead. \u201cTry topping the burger with extra vegetables like mushrooms, tomatoes, and pickles. Instead of having chips or fries on the side, try the vegetable of the day or a side salad,\u201d says Wilson.\n\nRead next: \u301015\u2020The Healthiest Fast Food Orders for When You\u2019re on a Road Trip, According to Dietitians\u3011\n\n\u301016\u2020dietitian\u3011 \u301017\u2020expert\u3011 \u301018\u2020experts\u3011 \u301019\u2020international\u3011 \u301020\u2020nutritionist\u3011 \u301021\u2020restaurants\u3011 \u301022\u2020take-out\u3011 \n\n[Image] \n\nGood food brings people together.

But while the noodle dishes are tempting, a better bet for your health is to go for the red curry with chicken. At American Thai take-out restaurants, red curries tend to have more vegetables than green curries, says Nicole Swingle, RD. \u201cI also opt for brown steamed rice on the side and sometimes ask for them to please swap more vegetables into the curry. I also get the chicken satay for extra protein, and sometimes I\u2019ll also order the green papaya salad to share as an appetizer, too.\u201d\n\nAnother good choice is the cashew chicken stir fry with brown rice. This is a great option because it\u2019s a very balanced meal, and the sauce is generally pretty light. \u201cIt is high in lean protein from the chicken, offers some healthy fats from the cashews, and lots of high fiber and nutrient rice veggies are added to the stir fry. I like it with brown rice for extra fiber,\u201d says Kelsey Butler, RD.\n\n## Pizza\n\nFor pizza lovers, it can be difficult to enjoy your favorite food while also maintaining your health goals. But with some simple modifications, you can still enjoy your pizza take out without sacrificing flavor or nutrition. \u201cWe start by modifying the crust \u2014 either opt for a thin crust or a gluten free crust. Thin crust cuts down on calories, while a gluten free crust cuts down on inflammatory ingredients,\u201d says Trista Best, RD. \u201cNext, consider the toppings. Choose vegetables over fatty meats.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep serving size in mind, too. \u201cCut yourself smaller pieces,\u201d says Best. \u201cThe most important thing when eating any food is to honor your true fullness. This means that when you start to feel yourself getting full, stop eating and just enjoy the company you\u2019re in.\u201d Remember also that pizza can be part of a meal instead of the whole meal. Most local pizza places will also deliver a large Greek salad (ask for the dressing on the side so you can add only as much as you want), as well as healthy sides like saut\u00e9ed broccoli rabe. \n\n[Image: Indian food spread on the table \u2014 a delicious feast]\n\n## Indian\n\nThere\u2019s so much to love about Indian takeout, from naan to raita. But like a lot of restaurant food, it can have a lot of hidden fat and sodium. One of the best orders at an Indian take-out restaurant: the chicken jalfrezi curry. \u201cThis dish is made with bell peppers and onion, so it\u2019s well balanced with protein-rich chicken,\u201d says Butler. \u201cThe sauce is also broth-based, so there isn\u2019t as much saturated fat, unlike some of the creamier sauces. I pair this curry with brown rice to balance the meal with carbs and add more fiber.\u201d\n\n## Sushi\n\nSushi always feels like a healthy option, and it absolutely can be. But what you order really does matter. Instead of opting for a deep-fried roll (think anything with the words \u201ccrunch\u201d or \u201ctempura\u201d in the description), or Americanized rolls drizzled in spicy mayo, consider simpler dishes. One great meal, according to Mia Syn, MS, RDN, is a salmon avocado roll, sashimi, a side of steamed brown rice, and edamame. \n\n\u201cSalmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for brain and heart health, while avocado is a source of plant-based fats that can help enhance the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, K, and E,\u201d Syn says. \u201cBrown rice is a whole grain filled with fiber, which is important for digestive health and also helps you feel full longer. And edamame is a source of complete plant-based protein.\u201d\n\n## Chinese\n\nAmericanized Chinese takeout is simply delicious, but if you\u2019re ordering classics like sesame chicken and egg rolls, it can also be filled with sodium, sugar, and partially hydrogenated oils. \u201cStart your meal with steamed dumplings, hot and sour soup, or egg drop soup instead of egg rolls,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cAvoid battered and deep fried entrees such as General Tso\u2019s chicken and instead choose stir fried dishes such as shrimp or beef and broccoli, moo goo gai pan, or skewered proteins.\u201d Opt for sides of vegetable dishes, like eggplant with garlic sauce and garlic green beans. If you want a really healthy option, choose from the steamed menu, which is usually served with a side of your preferred dipping sauce. You can opt for a protein like tofu, chicken, or shrimp steamed with mixed vegetables, and then just dip each bite into the sauce on the side.\n\n## Mexican\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a healthy, plant-based option with fewer refined carbs, opt for a burrito bowl instead of a burrito.\n\n\u201cChoose a base of brown rice and beans for protein, and top it with fajita vegetables, salsa, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole,\u201d says vegan dietitian Stephanie Wells, MS, RD, ACSM-CPT.

But like a lot of restaurant food, it can have a lot of hidden fat and sodium. One of the best orders at an Indian take-out restaurant: the chicken jalfrezi curry. \u201cThis dish is made with bell peppers and onion, so it\u2019s well balanced with protein-rich chicken,\u201d says Butler. \u201cThe sauce is also broth-based, so there isn\u2019t as much saturated fat, unlike some of the creamier sauces. I pair this curry with brown rice to balance the meal with carbs and add more fiber.\u201d\n\n## Sushi\n\nSushi always feels like a healthy option, and it absolutely can be. But what you order really does matter. Instead of opting for a deep-fried roll (think anything with the words \u201ccrunch\u201d or \u201ctempura\u201d in the description), or Americanized rolls drizzled in spicy mayo, consider simpler dishes. One great meal, according to Mia Syn, MS, RDN, is a salmon avocado roll, sashimi, a side of steamed brown rice, and edamame. \n\n\u201cSalmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for brain and heart health, while avocado is a source of plant-based fats that can help enhance the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, K, and E,\u201d Syn says. \u201cBrown rice is a whole grain filled with fiber, which is important for digestive health and also helps you feel full longer. And edamame is a source of complete plant-based protein.\u201d\n\n## Chinese\n\nAmericanized Chinese takeout is simply delicious, but if you\u2019re ordering classics like sesame chicken and egg rolls, it can also be filled with sodium, sugar, and partially hydrogenated oils. \u201cStart your meal with steamed dumplings, hot and sour soup, or egg drop soup instead of egg rolls,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cAvoid battered and deep fried entrees such as General Tso\u2019s chicken and instead choose stir fried dishes such as shrimp or beef and broccoli, moo goo gai pan, or skewered proteins.\u201d Opt for sides of vegetable dishes, like eggplant with garlic sauce and garlic green beans. If you want a really healthy option, choose from the steamed menu, which is usually served with a side of your preferred dipping sauce. You can opt for a protein like tofu, chicken, or shrimp steamed with mixed vegetables, and then just dip each bite into the sauce on the side.\n\n## Mexican\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a healthy, plant-based option with fewer refined carbs, opt for a burrito bowl instead of a burrito.\n\n\u201cChoose a base of brown rice and beans for protein, and top it with fajita vegetables, salsa, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole,\u201d says vegan dietitian Stephanie Wells, MS, RD, ACSM-CPT. Some restaurants have started offering additional plant-based protein options made with tofu or pea protein, for example, which can be a great addition if you need a high-protein meal and don\u2019t eat meat. \u201cI love ordering this type of meal because it is quick, convenient, and balanced with all of the food groups important for a vegan or plant-based diet,\u201d says Wells.\n\nIt\u2019s the customization option that makes burrito bowls such a great option, but that works for fajitas, too. \u201cBoth bowls and fajitas are customizable options, which means you can control the protein, veggies, and starches added,\u201d says Butler. \u201cFor both, I go with a lean protein like chicken, fish, shrimp, or black beans. I then choose a fiber-rich carb like brown rice, black rice, or corn tortillas.\u201d\n\n## Burgers \n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a big, juicy burger with all the toppings. \u201cTo enhance the flavor and avoid processed flour, high fructose corn syrup, and additives, try ordering a burger without the bun,\u201d says Alyssa Wilson, RD. \n\nMost restaurants now have the option of choosing to turn your burger into a lettuce wrap instead. \u201cTry topping the burger with extra vegetables like mushrooms, tomatoes, and pickles. Instead of having chips or fries on the side, try the vegetable of the day or a side salad,\u201d says Wilson.\n\nRead next: The Healthiest Fast Food Orders for When You\u2019re on a Road Trip, According to Dietitians\n\ndietitian expert experts international nutritionist restaurants take-out \n\n[Image] \n\nGood food brings people together.

Choose vegetables over fatty meats.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep serving size in mind, too. \u201cCut yourself smaller pieces,\u201d says Best. \u201cThe most important thing when eating any food is to honor your true fullness. This means that when you start to feel yourself getting full, stop eating and just enjoy the company you\u2019re in.\u201d Remember also that pizza can be part of a meal instead of the whole meal. Most local pizza places will also deliver a large Greek salad (ask for the dressing on the side so you can add only as much as you want), as well as healthy sides like saut\u00e9ed broccoli rabe. \n\n[Image: Indian food spread on the table \u2014 a delicious feast]\n\n## Indian\n\nThere\u2019s so much to love about Indian takeout, from naan to raita. But like a lot of restaurant food, it can have a lot of hidden fat and sodium. One of the best orders at an Indian take-out restaurant: the chicken jalfrezi curry. \u201cThis dish is made with bell peppers and onion, so it\u2019s well balanced with protein-rich chicken,\u201d says Butler. \u201cThe sauce is also broth-based, so there isn\u2019t as much saturated fat, unlike some of the creamier sauces. I pair this curry with brown rice to balance the meal with carbs and add more fiber.\u201d\n\n## Sushi\n\nSushi always feels like a healthy option, and it absolutely can be. But what you order really does matter. Instead of opting for a deep-fried roll (think anything with the words \u201ccrunch\u201d or \u201ctempura\u201d in the description), or Americanized rolls drizzled in spicy mayo, consider simpler dishes. One great meal, according to Mia Syn, MS, RDN, is a salmon avocado roll, sashimi, a side of steamed brown rice, and edamame. \n\n\u201cSalmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for brain and heart health, while avocado is a source of plant-based fats that can help enhance the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, K, and E,\u201d Syn says. \u201cBrown rice is a whole grain filled with fiber, which is important for digestive health and also helps you feel full longer. And edamame is a source of complete plant-based protein.\u201d\n\n## Chinese\n\nAmericanized Chinese takeout is simply delicious, but if you\u2019re ordering classics like sesame chicken and egg rolls, it can also be filled with sodium, sugar, and partially hydrogenated oils. \u201cStart your meal with steamed dumplings, hot and sour soup, or egg drop soup instead of egg rolls,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cAvoid battered and deep fried entrees such as General Tso\u2019s chicken and instead choose stir fried dishes such as shrimp or beef and broccoli, moo goo gai pan, or skewered proteins.\u201d Opt for sides of vegetable dishes, like eggplant with garlic sauce and garlic green beans. If you want a really healthy option, choose from the steamed menu, which is usually served with a side of your preferred dipping sauce. You can opt for a protein like tofu, chicken, or shrimp steamed with mixed vegetables, and then just dip each bite into the sauce on the side.\n\n## Mexican\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a healthy, plant-based option with fewer refined carbs, opt for a burrito bowl instead of a burrito.\n\n\u201cChoose a base of brown rice and beans for protein, and top it with fajita vegetables, salsa, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole,\u201d says vegan dietitian Stephanie Wells, MS, RD, ACSM-CPT. Some restaurants have started offering additional plant-based protein options made with tofu or pea protein, for example, which can be a great addition if you need a high-protein meal and don\u2019t eat meat. \u201cI love ordering this type of meal because it is quick, convenient, and balanced with all of the food groups important for a vegan or plant-based diet,\u201d says Wells.\n\nIt\u2019s the customization option that makes burrito bowls such a great option, but that works for fajitas, too. \u201cBoth bowls and fajitas are customizable options, which means you can control the protein, veggies, and starches added,\u201d says Butler. \u201cFor both, I go with a lean protein like chicken, fish, shrimp, or black beans. I then choose a fiber-rich carb like brown rice, black rice, or corn tortillas.\u201d\n\n## Burgers \n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a big, juicy burger with all the toppings. \u201cTo enhance the flavor and avoid processed flour, high fructose corn syrup, and additives, try ordering a burger without the bun,\u201d says Alyssa Wilson, RD. \n\nMost restaurants now have the option of choosing to turn your burger into a lettuce wrap instead. \u201cTry topping the burger with extra vegetables like mushrooms, tomatoes, and pickles. Instead of having chips or fries on the side, try the vegetable of the day or a side salad,\u201d says Wilson.\n\nRead next: The Healthiest Fast Food Orders for When You\u2019re on a Road Trip, According to Dietitians\n\ndietitian expert experts international nutritionist restaurants take-out \n\n[Image] \n\nGood food brings people together.

But while the noodle dishes are tempting, a better bet for your health is to go for the red curry with chicken. At American Thai take-out restaurants, red curries tend to have more vegetables than green curries, says Nicole Swingle, RD. \u201cI also opt for brown steamed rice on the side and sometimes ask for them to please swap more vegetables into the curry. I also get the chicken satay for extra protein, and sometimes I\u2019ll also order the green papaya salad to share as an appetizer, too.\u201d\n\nAnother good choice is the cashew chicken stir fry with brown rice. This is a great option because it\u2019s a very balanced meal, and the sauce is generally pretty light. \u201cIt is high in lean protein from the chicken, offers some healthy fats from the cashews, and lots of high fiber and nutrient rice veggies are added to the stir fry. I like it with brown rice for extra fiber,\u201d says Kelsey Butler, RD.\n\n## Pizza\n\nFor pizza lovers, it can be difficult to enjoy your favorite food while also maintaining your health goals. But with some simple modifications, you can still enjoy your pizza take out without sacrificing flavor or nutrition. \u201cWe start by modifying the crust \u2014 either opt for a thin crust or a gluten free crust. Thin crust cuts down on calories, while a gluten free crust cuts down on inflammatory ingredients,\u201d says Trista Best, RD. \u201cNext, consider the toppings. Choose vegetables over fatty meats.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep serving size in mind, too. \u201cCut yourself smaller pieces,\u201d says Best. \u201cThe most important thing when eating any food is to honor your true fullness. This means that when you start to feel yourself getting full, stop eating and just enjoy the company you\u2019re in.\u201d Remember also that pizza can be part of a meal instead of the whole meal. Most local pizza places will also deliver a large Greek salad (ask for the dressing on the side so you can add only as much as you want), as well as healthy sides like saut\u00e9ed broccoli rabe. \n\n[Image: Indian food spread on the table \u2014 a delicious feast]\n\n## Indian\n\nThere\u2019s so much to love about Indian takeout, from naan to raita. But like a lot of restaurant food, it can have a lot of hidden fat and sodium. One of the best orders at an Indian take-out restaurant: the chicken jalfrezi curry. \u201cThis dish is made with bell peppers and onion, so it\u2019s well balanced with protein-rich chicken,\u201d says Butler. \u201cThe sauce is also broth-based, so there isn\u2019t as much saturated fat, unlike some of the creamier sauces. I pair this curry with brown rice to balance the meal with carbs and add more fiber.\u201d\n\n## Sushi\n\nSushi always feels like a healthy option, and it absolutely can be. But what you order really does matter. Instead of opting for a deep-fried roll (think anything with the words \u201ccrunch\u201d or \u201ctempura\u201d in the description), or Americanized rolls drizzled in spicy mayo, consider simpler dishes. One great meal, according to Mia Syn, MS, RDN, is a salmon avocado roll, sashimi, a side of steamed brown rice, and edamame. \n\n\u201cSalmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for brain and heart health, while avocado is a source of plant-based fats that can help enhance the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, K, and E,\u201d Syn says. \u201cBrown rice is a whole grain filled with fiber, which is important for digestive health and also helps you feel full longer. And edamame is a source of complete plant-based protein.\u201d\n\n## Chinese\n\nAmericanized Chinese takeout is simply delicious, but if you\u2019re ordering classics like sesame chicken and egg rolls, it can also be filled with sodium, sugar, and partially hydrogenated oils. \u201cStart your meal with steamed dumplings, hot and sour soup, or egg drop soup instead of egg rolls,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cAvoid battered and deep fried entrees such as General Tso\u2019s chicken and instead choose stir fried dishes such as shrimp or beef and broccoli, moo goo gai pan, or skewered proteins.\u201d Opt for sides of vegetable dishes, like eggplant with garlic sauce and garlic green beans. If you want a really healthy option, choose from the steamed menu, which is usually served with a side of your preferred dipping sauce. You can opt for a protein like tofu, chicken, or shrimp steamed with mixed vegetables, and then just dip each bite into the sauce on the side.\n\n## Mexican\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a healthy, plant-based option with fewer refined carbs, opt for a burrito bowl instead of a burrito.\n\n\u201cChoose a base of brown rice and beans for protein, and top it with fajita vegetables, salsa, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole,\u201d says vegan dietitian Stephanie Wells, MS, RD, ACSM-CPT. Some restaurants have started offering additional plant-based protein options made with tofu or pea protein, for example, which can be a great addition if you need a high-protein meal and don\u2019t eat meat. \u201cI love ordering this type of meal because it is quick, convenient, and balanced with all of the food groups important for a vegan or plant-based diet,\u201d says Wells.\n\nIt\u2019s the customization option that makes burrito bowls such a great option, but that works for fajitas, too. \u201cBoth bowls and fajitas are customizable options, which means you can control the protein, veggies, and starches added,\u201d says Butler. \u201cFor both, I go with a lean protein like chicken, fish, shrimp, or black beans. I then choose a fiber-rich carb like brown rice, black rice, or corn tortillas.\u201d\n\n## Burgers \n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a big, juicy burger with all the toppings. \u201cTo enhance the flavor and avoid processed flour, high fructose corn syrup, and additives, try ordering a burger without the bun,\u201d says Alyssa Wilson, RD. \n\nMost restaurants now have the option of choosing to turn your burger into a lettuce wrap instead. \u201cTry topping the burger with extra vegetables like mushrooms, tomatoes, and pickles. Instead of having chips or fries on the side, try the vegetable of the day or a side salad,\u201d says Wilson.\n\nRead next: The Healthiest Fast Food Orders for When You\u2019re on a Road Trip, According to Dietitians\n\ndietitian expert experts international nutritionist restaurants take-out \n\n[Image] \n\nGood food brings people together.

With breakfast-friendly staples on hand like yogurt, whole-wheat bread or frozen fruit, you can whip up delicious toasts, parfaits or frosty smoothies in no time. Whether you want something simple, like a peanut butter-banana sandwich, or something a little indulgent, like avocado toast with buttery mozzarella cheese, there&#x27;s a recipe for you. Recipes like our Pecan Butter &amp; Pear Toast and Anti-Inflammatory Cherry-Spinach Smoothie will have you feeling ready to face the day ahead. \n\n01 of 25\n\n##   Spinach, Peanut Butter &amp; Banana Smoothie \n\n \u301063\u2020 View Recipe\u3011\n\n[Image: Spinach, Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie]  [Image: Spinach, Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie] \n\n Ted &amp; Chelsea Cavanaugh\n\n Peanut butter and banana is a classic combo that&#x27;s even more delicious with the addition of tangy probiotic-rich kefir. Plus, this peanut butter banana smoothie helps you up your veggie servings for the day with a bit of mild-flavored spinach mixed in. \n\n02 of 25\n\n##   Avocado-Egg Toast \n\n \u301064\u2020 View Recipe\u3011\n\n[Image: Avocado-Egg Toast]  [Image: Avocado-Egg Toast] \n\n Try it once and we think you&#x27;ll agree: Topping avocado toast with an egg is a near-perfect breakfast. \n\n03 of 25\n\n##   White Bean &amp; Avocado Toast \n\n \u301065\u2020 View Recipe\u3011\n\n[Image: 4582996.jpg]  [Image: 4582996.jpg] \n\n Mashed avocado and white beans make for a fiber-rich and creamy topping, the perfect partner for a crispy slice of toast. Try it for a quick breakfast or snack. \n\n04 of 25\n\n##   Pecan Butter &amp; Pear Toast \n\n \u301066\u2020 View Recipe\u3011\n\n[Image: Pecan Butter &amp; Pear Toast]  [Image: Pecan Butter &amp; Pear Toast] \n\n Ted &amp; Chelsea Cavanaugh\n\n For a quick breakfast or snack, try this three-ingredient toast. Pecan butter adds a nutty flavor, which gets balanced by the natural sweetness of the pear. \n\n05 of 25\n\n##   Ricotta-Berry Crepes \n\n \u301067\u2020 View Recipe\u3011\n\n[Image: 8530331.jpg]  [Image: 8530331.jpg] \n\n Make a big batch of these easy 3-ingredient crepes to stash in your freezer so you always have a healthy breakfast on hand. A dollop of ricotta adds protein to a store-bought crepe, while the berries give a burst of sweetness and a little fiber. \n\n06 of 25\n\n##   Cashew Butter &amp; Clementine Toast \n\n \u301068\u2020 View Recipe\u3011\n\n[Image: Cashew Butter &amp; Clementine Toast]  [Image: Cashew Butter &amp; Clementine Toast] \n\n Ted &amp; Chelsea Cavanaugh\n\n This three-ingredient toast uses a fresh clementine and cashew butter for a twist on the classic PB &amp; J. Enjoy this toast for a quick breakfast or snack. \n\n07 of 25\n\n##   Avocado Toast with Burrata \n\n \u301069\u2020 View Recipe\u3011\n\n[Image: Avocado Toast with Burrata]  [Image: Avocado Toast with Burrata] \n\n Burrata (cream-filled fresh mozzarella cheese) takes this avocado toast recipe to the next level for a decadent, yet weekday-friendly breakfast. \n\n08 of 25\n\n##   Anti-Inflammatory Cherry-Spinach Smoothie \n\n \u301070\u2020 View Recipe\u3011\n\n[Image: 6768424.jpg]  [Image: 6768424.jpg] \n\n This healthy smoothie is not only delicious--it also boosts your daily dose of anti-inflammatory foods. It starts with a base of creamy gut-friendly kefir and includes cherries, which can lower the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein. Heart-healthy fats in avocado, almond butter and chia seeds deliver additional anti-inflammatory compounds to the body, while spinach offers a mix of antioxidants that sweep up harmful free radicals. Fresh ginger adds zing, plus a compound called gingerol, which preliminary studies suggest may improve inflammatory markers of heart disease if consumed daily. \n\n09 of 25\n\n##   Coconut Blueberry Smoothie \n\n \u301071\u2020 View Recipe\u3011\n\n[Image: 8265793.jpg]  [Image: 8265793.jpg] \n\n Give your blueberry smoothie a tropical update with the rich flavors of coconut milk and coconut cream. Freshly squeezed orange juice lends bright flavor to this healthy smoothie recipe, but if you&#x27;re short on time, bottled will work just fine. \n\n10 of 25\n\n##   Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast \n\n \u301072\u2020 View Recipe\u3011\n\n[Image: Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast]  [Image: Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast] \n\n This satisfying peanut butter-banana toast gets a sprinkle of cinnamon for an extra flavor boost. \n\n11 of 25\n\n##   Mascarpone\nVisible: 15% - 60%", "summary": "www.eatingwell.com (www.eatingwell.com)\n"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"title": "www.eatingwell.com", "url": "https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7944140/healthy-5-minute-breakfast-recipes/", "text": "\n\n  *  About Us  \n\nAbout Us\n\n    *  Nutrition Guidelines \n    *  View All \n\n  *   Log In \n  * My Account\n\nMy Account\n\n    *  Log Out \n\n  *  Newsletter\n  *  Sweepstakes \n\nFollow Us\n\n  *  Facebook \n  *  Flipboard \n  *  Instagram \n  *  Pinterest \n  *  Twitter \n  *  YouTube \n\n  *  Healthy Recipes \n    *  Dinner \n    *  Quick &amp; Easy \n    *  Breakfast &amp; Brunch \n    *  Lunch \n    *  Appetizers \n    *  Side Dishes \n    *  Salads \n    *  Soup \n    *  Desserts \n    *  Smoothies \n    *  Snacks \n    *  View All \n  *  Special Diets \n    *  Mediterranean Diet \n    *  Anti-Inflammatory Diet \n    *  Weight Loss \n    *  Heart Health \n    *  Gluten-Free \n    *  Vegetarian \n    *  Vegan \n    *  View All \n  *  Diabetes \n    *  Meal Plans for Diabetes \n    *  Diabetes-Friendly Recipes \n    *  View All \n  *  Meal Plans \n    *  Dinner Plans \n    *  Weight-Loss Meal Plans \n    *  Low-Carb Meal Plans \n    *  Low-Cholesterol Meal Plans \n    *  Mediterranean Diet Meal Plans \n    *  Low-Sodium Meal Plans \n    *  ThePrep \n    *  View All \n  *  News \n    *  Features \n    *  View All \n  *  Healthy Eating \n    *  How to Eat Healthy \n    *  Best Healthy Foods \n    *  Healthy Cooking How-Tos \n    *  Healthy Eating for Kids \n    *  Good Food Fast \n    *  Beer, Wine &amp; Spirits Guide \n    *  View All \n  *  Healthy Lifestyle \n    *  EatingWell in Real Life \n    *  Entertaining \n    *  Kitchen Essentials \n    *  Sustainability \n    *  View All \n\n About Us \n\n  *  Our Food &amp; Nutrition Philosophy \n\n  *   Healthy Cooking Methods &amp; Styles\n  *   Quick &amp; Easy Healthy Recipes\n  *   Healthy, Quick &amp; Easy Breakfast &amp; Brunch Recipes\n  *   Healthy 10-Minute Breakfast &amp; Brunch Recipes\n\n#  25 Healthy Breakfasts You Can Make in 5 Minutes\n\n By\n\nLeah Goggins\n\n[Image: Leah Goggins headshot]  [Image: Leah Goggins headshot] \n\n Leah Goggins\n\n  *  Instagram \n  *  Website \n\nLeah Goggins is a digital fellow for EatingWell.

With breakfast-friendly staples on hand like yogurt, whole-wheat bread or frozen fruit, you can whip up delicious toasts, parfaits or frosty smoothies in no time.

Recipes like our Pecan Butter &amp; Pear Toast and Anti-Inflammatory Cherry-Spinach Smoothie will have you feeling ready to face the day ahead. \n\n01 of 25\n\n##   Spinach, Peanut Butter &amp; Banana Smoothie \n\n  View Recipe\n\n[Image: Spinach, Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie]  [Image: Spinach, Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie] \n\n Ted &amp; Chelsea Cavanaugh\n\n Peanut butter and banana is a classic combo that&#x27;s even more delicious with the addition of tangy probiotic-rich kefir.

It starts with a base of creamy gut-friendly kefir and includes cherries, which can lower the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein. Heart-healthy fats in avocado, almond butter and chia seeds deliver additional anti-inflammatory compounds to the body, while spinach offers a mix of antioxidants that sweep up harmful free radicals. Fresh ginger adds zing, plus a compound called gingerol, which preliminary studies suggest may improve inflammatory markers of heart disease if consumed daily. \n\n09 of 25\n\n##   Coconut Blueberry Smoothie \n\n  View Recipe\n\n[Image: 8265793.jpg]  [Image: 8265793.jpg] \n\n Give your blueberry smoothie a tropical update with the rich flavors of coconut milk and coconut cream. Freshly squeezed orange juice lends bright flavor to this healthy smoothie recipe, but if you&#x27;re short on time, bottled will work just fine. \n\n10 of 25\n\n##   Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast \n\n  View Recipe\n\n[Image: Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast]  [Image: Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast] \n\n This satisfying peanut butter-banana toast gets a sprinkle of cinnamon for an extra flavor boost. \n\n11 of 25\n\n##   Mascarpone\nVisible: 15% - 60%", "pub_date": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "quote", "args": ["Anti-Inflammatory Cherry-Spinach Smoothie", "sweep up harmful free radicals.

Because learning to make something like dough requires actually showing you, we\u2019ve made a video to show the dough-making process. Here are a few tips about the dough to remember when making it: then watch the video above to see it in action: \n\n  * Make the dough 1 hour before serving OR make in advance. Making the dough takes only 15 minutes of hands on time. Then it rests for 45 minutes to proof before it\u2019s ready to stretch. If you don\u2019t have 1 hour before serving, you can make it up to 3 days in advance and refrigerate. \n  * Thin crust pizza dough is easy to shape: roll it! This pizza dough is easier to shape than our \u301052\u2020Pizza Dough Master Recipe\u3011 because you roll it out with a rolling pin! This crust is easy to make: see the video above. \n  * Use Tipo 00 flour if you can find it. Our favorite flour for making pizza dough is what the Italians use: it\u2019s called Tipo 00 and it makes the crust light and fluffy. You can find at it some grocery stores or \u301053\u2020online here\u2020rstyle.me\u3011. \n\n[Image: Loaded veggie healthy pizza recipe][Image: Loaded veggie healthy pizza recipe]\n\n## This recipe is\u2026\n\nVegetarian.

Make the pizza dough: Follow the \u301039\u2020Easy Thin Crust Pizza Dough\u3011 recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)\n  2. Place a \u301058\u2020pizza stone\u3011 in the oven and preheat to 500\u00b0F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here\u2019s the \u301059\u2020pizza oven we use\u2020rstyle.me\u3011).\n  3. Make the pizza sauce: Make the \u301040\u2020Easy Pizza Sauce\u3011.\n  4. Prepare the toppings: Thinly \u301060\u2020slice the peppers\u3011. Thinly \u301061\u2020slice the red onion\u3011. Thinly \u301062\u2020slice the garlic\u3011. In a skillet, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and \u00bc teaspoon \u301057\u2020kosher salt\u3011. Saute the vegetables, stirring often, for about 7 to 10 minutes, until browned and very soft. Stir in the oregano and remove from the heat.\n  5. Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a \u301045\u2020pizza peel\u2020rstyle.me\u3011 with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don\u2019t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see \u301063\u2020How to Stretch Pizza Dough\u3011 for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.\n  6. Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Sprinkle with the vegetables, drained capers, and Parmesan cheese.\n  7. Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).\n  8. While the pizza is baking, mix the baby arugula with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of \u301057\u2020kosher salt\u3011. When the pizza is done, top with the arugula. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.\n\n  * Category: Pizza \n  * Method: Baked \n  * Cuisine: Italian\n\nKeywords: Healthy Pizza, Healthy Pizza Recipe, Veggie Pizza Recipe, Veggie Pizza\n\n### Did you make this recipe?\n\nTag \u301064\u2020@acouplecooks\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011 on Instagram and hashtag it \u301065\u2020#acouplecooks\u2020www.instagram.com\u3011\n\nPublished on October 1, 2019 / Last updated on May 17, 2020 \n\n### Categorized In:\n\n  * \u30103\u2020Dinner Recipes\u3011\n  * \u30102\u2020Recipes\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Special Occasion Dinner Recipes\u3011\n\n### Tagged with:\n\n  * \u301066\u2020Artisan Pizza\u3011\n  * \u301067\u2020Arugula\u3011\n  * \u301068\u2020Capers\u3011\n  * \u301069\u2020Healthy\u3011\n  * \u301070\u2020Homemade Pizza\u3011\n  * \u301071\u2020Peppers\u3011\n  * \u301072\u2020Pizza\u3011\n  * \u301073\u2020Pizza Sauce\u3011\n  * \u301074\u2020Thin Crust\u3011\n  * \u301075\u2020Vegetarian\u3011\n\n## About the authors\n\n[Image][Image]\n\n## Sonja &amp; Alex \n\nMeet Sonja and Alex Overhiser: Husband and wife.

Because learning to make something like dough requires actually showing you, we\u2019ve made a video to show the dough-making process. Here are a few tips about the dough to remember when making it: then watch the video above to see it in action: \n\n  * Make the dough 1 hour before serving OR make in advance. Making the dough takes only 15 minutes of hands on time. Then it rests for 45 minutes to proof before it\u2019s ready to stretch. If you don\u2019t have 1 hour before serving, you can make it up to 3 days in advance and refrigerate. \n  * Thin crust pizza dough is easy to shape: roll it! This pizza dough is easier to shape than our Pizza Dough Master Recipe because you roll it out with a rolling pin! This crust is easy to make: see the video above. \n  * Use Tipo 00 flour if you can find it. Our favorite flour for making pizza dough is what the Italians use: it\u2019s called Tipo 00 and it makes the crust light and fluffy. You can find at it some grocery stores or online here. \n\n[Image: Loaded veggie healthy pizza recipe][Image: Loaded veggie healthy pizza recipe]\n\n## This recipe is\u2026\n\nVegetarian.

Yes, this is the BEST healthy pizza you\u2019ll find.\n\n* * *\n\n### Ingredients\n\nScale 1x 2x 3x\n\n  * 1 ball Easy Thin Crust Dough\n  * \u00bd cup Easy Pizza Sauce\n  * 1/2 yellow bell pepper\n  * 1/2 red bell pepper\n  * 1/4 medium red onion\n  * 1 garlic clove\n  * 1 tablespoon olive oil\n  * \u00bd teaspoon dried oregano, plus more for garnish\n  * \u00bd tablespoon capers, drained\n  * \u00bc cup grated Parmesan cheese\n  * \u00bd cup baby arugula\n  * Kosher salt\n  * Olive oil\n  * Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel\n\n Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark \n\n* * *\n\n### Instructions\n\n  1. Make the pizza dough: Follow the Easy Thin Crust Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)\n  2. Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500\u00b0F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here\u2019s the pizza oven we use).\n  3. Make the pizza sauce: Make the Easy Pizza Sauce.\n  4. Prepare the toppings: Thinly slice the peppers. Thinly slice the red onion. Thinly slice the garlic. In a skillet, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and \u00bc teaspoon kosher salt. Saute the vegetables, stirring often, for about 7 to 10 minutes, until browned and very soft. Stir in the oregano and remove from the heat.\n  5. Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don\u2019t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.\n  6. Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Sprinkle with the vegetables, drained capers, and Parmesan cheese.\n  7. Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).\n  8. While the pizza is baking, mix the baby arugula with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of kosher salt. When the pizza is done, top with the arugula. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.\n\n  * Category: Pizza \n  * Method: Baked \n  * Cuisine: Italian\n\nKeywords: Healthy Pizza, Healthy Pizza Recipe, Veggie Pizza Recipe, Veggie Pizza\n\n### Did you make this recipe?\n\nTag @acouplecooks on Instagram and hashtag it #acouplecooks\n\nPublished on October 1, 2019 / Last updated on May 17, 2020 \n\n### Categorized In:\n\n  * Dinner Recipes\n  * Recipes\n  * Special Occasion Dinner Recipes\n\n### Tagged with:\n\n  * Artisan Pizza\n  * Arugula\n  * Capers\n  * Healthy\n  * Homemade Pizza\n  * Peppers\n  * Pizza\n  * Pizza Sauce\n  * Thin Crust\n  * Vegetarian\n\n## About the authors\n\n[Image][Image]\n\n## Sonja &amp; Alex \n\nMeet Sonja and Alex Overhiser: Husband and wife.

This dressing is one of our favorites, and it comes together quickly. The only thing you need to know is how to get the perfect emulsion. Emulsion is when the olive oil and vinegar combine into a creamy liquid, versus separating into their separate parts. Here\u2019s what to remember: \n\n  * Use a medium sized bowl.

But they only take a few minutes of hands on time, and take this Italian salad to the next level! It\u2019s a great way to use up bread that\u2019s starting to get stale. All you\u2019ll need is 15 minutes to bake (and the oven preheat time). The garlic flavor and the massive crunch is absolutely worth the time. Another reason to make homemade? They have no preservatives, and they don\u2019t overdo it on the salt. \n\nYou can also make the croutons in advance. Just store them in a sealed container at room temperature until serving. They last for about 1 week, but are best when fresh. You can absolutely omit for a gluten-free salad and it still tastes great. \n\n[Image: Italian salad][Image: Italian salad]\n\n## Ways to serve Italian salad\n\nThis Italian salad is perfect with Mediterranean or Italian-style foods like pizza and pasta. You can even make it into a main dish! Here\u2019s what we recommend: \n\n  * Make it a main dish salad. Add \u301039\u2020hard boiled eggs\u3011, white beans, tuna, or chopped chicken.\n  * Serve with pizza. This our favorite way to serve it! Try it with \u301040\u2020Margherita Pizza\u3011, \u301041\u2020Perfect Pan Pizza\u3011, \u301042\u2020Eggplant Pizza\u3011, \u301043\u2020Flatbread Pizza\u3011, \u301044\u2020Best Healthy Pizza\u3011, or \u301045\u2020Homemade Cheese Pizza\u3011.\n  * Serve with lasagna. Try our \u301046\u2020Favorite Vegan Lasagna\u3011 or \u301047\u2020Spicy Kale Lasagna\u3011. \n  * Serve with pasta. It\u2019s perfect with \u301048\u2020Roasted Cauliflower Pasta\u3011, \u301049\u2020Pasta Primavera\u3011 or \u301050\u2020Roasted Eggplant Pasta\u3011. \n  * Serve with soup.

Hailing from the region of Piedmont in Italy, it is a simple mixture of sweetened cream and gelatine. A good panna cotta is one that is only just set but can still stand unsupported once out of the mould. Panna cotta is very easy to make and can be made the day before a \u3010112\u2020dinner party\u3011 to save time.\n\nTraditionally panna cotta was always made with just cream; however, as tastes change and people move away from heavy foods, chefs now tend to use a percentage of milk in their recipes to make panna cotta a lighter dessert which is also healthier.\n\nIngredients \n\n  * 300ml of cream \n  * 200ml of milk \n  * 60g of sugar \n  * 1 vanilla pod \n  * 2 gelatine leaves, softened in cold water \n\n1 \n\nScrape the seeds from the vanilla pod and add both to a saucepan with the milk, cream and sugar\n\n2 \n\nWarm gently over a low heat, being careful not to let the milk boil\n\n3 \n\nRemove from the heat and stir through the gelatine leaves until dissolved\n\n4 \n\nPass through a fine sieve into a jug and leave to cool to room temperature, stirring every few minutes\n\n5 \n\nOnce cool, stir one last time to evenly distribute the vanilla then divide between 4 moulds. Transfer to the fridge to set for at least 3 hours\n\n6 \n\nTo serve, run the moulds under warm water for a few seconds before carefully turning out the panna cottas onto a plate\n\n## Variations \n\nAs it is such a simple creation, panna cotta benefits from the addition of flavourings. Alan Murchison flavours his \u3010113\u2020panna cotta\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011 with white chocolate, Josh Eggleton uses \u3010114\u2020caramel\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011 for a intense richness and Greg Malouf creates a floral \u3010115\u2020panna cotta\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011 with the addition of rose and buttermilk. Most herbs and sweet spices work well; you could try mint, lavender, elderflower or even honey. \n\n## Serving suggestions \n\nShaun Hill perfectly executes a \u3010116\u2020Vanilla panna cotta\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011 and accompanies with fresh summer berries for a simple yet stunning dessert. Vineet Bhatia pairs his interesting \u3010117\u2020Cardamom panna cotta\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011 with grilled peaches and rich white chocolate while panna cotta makes up part of Matthew Tomkinson&#x27;s time consuming but spectacular \u3010118\u2020Assiette of Apple dessert\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011. \n\n## Subscribe to the \n\n## Great British Chefs Newsletter \n\nJoin an ever-growing community of food lovers now by subscribing to our newsletter and get all the latest recipes, features and much more to your inbox \n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nTerms and conditions \n\n## Get in touch\n\nPlease sign in or register to send a comment to Great British Chefs \n\nYou may also like\n\n\u3010119\u2020Great British Chefs Panna cotta with rhubarb, blood orange and grappa Panna cotta with rhubarb, blood orange and grappa by Ruth Rogers\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011\n\nRedirecting to sign-in... \n\n\u3010120\u2020Great British Chefs Woodruff panna cotta with raspberry and basil Woodruff panna cotta with raspberry and basil by Ivan Tisdall-Downes\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011\n\nRedirecting to sign-in... \n\n\u3010121\u2020Great British Chefs Elderflower panna cotta with wild strawberry sorbet, yoghurt crumble and elderflower vinegar granita Elderflower panna cotta with wild strawberry sorbe... by Josh Overington\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011\n\nRedirecting to sign-in... \n\n\u3010122\u2020Great British Chefs Basil and buttermilk pudding with poached figs Basil and buttermilk pudding with poached figs by Mark Dodson\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011\n\nRedirecting to sign-in... \n\n\u3010123\u2020Great British Chefs Yoghurt panna cotta with pink grapefruit jelly Yoghurt panna cotta with pink grapefruit jelly by Skye Gyngell\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011\n\nRedirecting to sign-in... \n\n\u3010124\u2020How to make whey How to make whey\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011\n\nRedirecting to sign-in... \n\n\u3010125\u2020Great British Chefs Rhubarb panna cotta, poached rhubarb, warm almond cakes Rhubarb panna cotta, poached rhubarb, warm almond ... by Chantelle Nicholson\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011\n\nRedirecting to sign-in... \n\n\u3010126\u2020Great British Chefs Bay panna cotta with rhubarb parfait Bay panna cotta with rhubarb parfait by Dean Parker\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011\n\nRedirecting to sign-in... \n\n\u3010127\u2020Lemon panna cotta with raspberry jelly Lemon panna cotta with raspberry jelly by Manuela Zangara\u3011\n\nRedirecting to sign-in... \n\n\u3010128\u2020Great British Chefs Cucumber panna cotta with strawberries, lemon thyme and honeycomb Cucumber panna cotta with strawberries, lemon thym... by Food Urchin\u2020www.greatbritishchefs.com\u3011\n\nRedirecting to sign-in... \n\nLoad more \n\n### NAVIGATE\n\n  * \u3010129\u2020Home\u3011\n  * \u3010130\u2020Italian Michelin Guide Results 2019\u3011\n  * \u301058\u2020Recipes\u3011\n  * \u3010131\u2020Ingredients\u3011\n  * \u3010132\u2020Recipe collections\u3011\n  * \u3010109\u2020Features\u3011\n  * \u3010133\u2020Regions of Italy\u3011\n  * \u301059\u2020Che\nVisible: 46% -

RPG - YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZVucdcchvI\n\nTranscript:\n(00:00) I recently attended Gary Khan and had the privilege of sitting in a GM masterclass panel run by Ed Greenwood and Andrew valkauskas now Ed Greenwood of course is the creator of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting and Andrew created the fate of the norns role-playing game I&#x27;ve been reading Forgotten Realms novels and running my games in that campaign setting since I was a little kid so you can imagine my excitement as I sat at the feet of masters with my notebook and Pen ready so as follows are the 10 game master\n(00:31) Secrets I walked away with number one flip the script when you&#x27;re designing adventures and running games seek to upset or overturn expectations do things that are unexpected but don&#x27;t just make it random crap for instance recently in a game my players were at the end of the adventure confronting the big bad whose cronies were running a laboratory now they had just been murder hoboing their way through the adventure up until that point even though the creatures living there hadn&#x27;t initiated hostilities\n(00:59) however they then learned why the big bad was at the laboratory he had been treated horribly by a nearby Village mocked ridiculed and Outcast left to die in the wild and now he was bent on visiting Justice mixed with a bit of Revenge I suppose on the villagers when my players learned this instantly two of them sympathize with the creature no longer wish to harm him and felt perhaps a bit guilty about what they had been doing up until that point number two characters are not the prime movers you should strive to make your game and\n(01:33) World feel larger and grander and one way to do this is by placing powerful personages and factions in the world that are working behind the scene now of course your player&#x27;s characters are in the spotlight of your game that&#x27;s all good and well however they should get the sense that there is more going on in the world than just the adventures they personally undergo they should feel that there are other powerful factors working their influence on the region and wider world as a game master you can accomplish this in a variety of ways\n(02:02) rumors the characters over here at the tavern other adventuring parties that pass through town and rub elbows with the player&#x27;s characters or powerful people and factions that influence or set in motion the very quests your players will go on and those are just a few examples excuse me Mr dungeon master but your Maps really suck what was that yeah your your Maps suck you you could really use an upgrade look I don&#x27;t have hours to create amazing digital maps for my games okay you get what you get um actually you don&#x27;t need hours with\n(02:36) chipaku maps you can get over 4 000 maps for just five dollars wait really yeah chepeku specializes in digital fantasy maps for role-playing games like d d and Pathfinder they even do animated maps I mean look at these amazing Maps aren&#x27;t they just the most beautiful things you&#x27;ve ever seen yeah and those look expensive um actually their animated maps are only ten dollars a month and you&#x27;ll even get their Foundry vtt module I don&#x27;t use Foundry vtt not to worry chapeku Maps work in every virtual\n(03:12) tabletop including Alchemy RPG roll 20 encounter plus boundary fantasy grounds and more okay I&#x27;m rather out of excuses now how do I get the maps already you can get beautifully crafted maps for your d d and fantasy role-playing games by becoming a chipaku patron at the link below cool now how about we go back to the game now eh number three the importance of a PC backstory besides the standard reasons that players might want to have backstories there is another important one characters must know why they are working with the other\n(03:46) characters and the reason for that should be baked into each character&#x27;s backstory this helps the group avoid one of the classic RPG pitfalls characters who have no reason to work with the other PCS and consequently wander off on their own yes good players will stay together anyway but even good players are well served by having role-playing reasons to Adventure with the other characters number four give your players something to do there&#x27;s this idea floating around out there that a game master need only create the world and\n(04:20) then plop the player&#x27;s characters down in the middle of it is then up to the characters to find something interesting to do in the world this sort of gameplay might appeal to some groups but it often leads to directionless and pointless hours of characters wandering around essentially doing nothing of interest in other words boring games instead the game master should give the characters options and choices of things they might do these are your traditional plot hooks that point them toward Adventures that\n(04:49) they might go on quests they might Undertake and the like number five everyone loves a mystery put something mysterious in your world or a handful of mysterious somethings upon which the fate of the world does not depend having a mystery around which your campaign is built is ordinary not a bad thing to do but it&#x27;s ordinary it&#x27;s expected instead you should have other Mysteries dotting the game world that your players might come across those Mysteries might lead them on side quests they might be small\n(05:17) Curiosities that are investigated and resolved and but a portion of a game session but any way you slice it they should be considered optional things your players may or may not care to investigate they are purely there to enrich the game by the way if you&#x27;re finding this information useful please give me a thumbs up and leave a comment for the algorithm down below let us know what GM secret you&#x27;ve learned over the years that has helped you run awesome games number six time keeping is not optional timekeeping is not the sexiest\n(05:46) of things for game Masters but when done correctly it can add flavor and realism to your campaign making your game and your world come to life and feel real to players it&#x27;s obvious to track the dates of things your players have done or upcoming dates of things that will affect characters however beyond that consider keeping track of things in the larger World things that have nothing to do with the PCS really but that they might hear about and that might indirectly affect what happens around them furthermore track the small local\n(06:17) stuff for instance next week Wednesday there is a parade through the village to commemorate the christening of the local church know when the local holidays are and describe them as they come to pass this sort of attention to detail can elevate a game from decent to Great number seven game prep is Paramount lazy game Masters the world over probably cringe every time I harp on the subject of game preparation because I am a firm believer in the GM spending quality time preparing for their game and Ed Greenwood upheld my lifelong stance on\n(06:50) this when he uttered one simple sentence it&#x27;s better to prepare more than less even if you are a masterful GM with Decades of experience your game game will be better the more you prep for it yes you may still be able to run a great game with no problem but imagine what you could do if you actually tried number eight the world rolls on things happen in the world even if the characters do nothing remember how you gave them the choice between three different quests save the dragon from The Evil Princess rescue the kobolds\n(07:21) from their imprisonment in the sewers or capture and tame all bears to use as bounce and we all know your players went after the owl Bears so while they were doing that the princess carved up the dragon and served him as steak at a banquet and the Cobalts all died from disease in the foul nasty sewers now it doesn&#x27;t have to be as dramatic as that but your players should get the feeling that the world around them is moving forward and changing and things are happening sometimes in response to what they do or don&#x27;t do and sometimes quite\n(07:54) independently number nine Get Better by doing as game Masters we all want to run awesome games where we and our players have tons of fun however we can sometimes fall into the Trap of thinking that we should be able to do that instantly right out of the gate and yet as with most things in life becoming good at something requires experience time spent doing that thing and intentionally trying to improve I mentioned this last part because we have all known people that have done X thing for years and decades and yet still suck\n(08:27) at it if you aren&#x27;t committed to continual Improvement then seniority and time on the job is rather meaningless number 10 a word on disruptive players all game Masters have to deal with problem players from time to time it comes with the territory and shared something really cool and yet also rather simple remind disruptive players that they will get out of the game session whatever they put into the game session and I think that&#x27;s true for all of us game Masters and players the higher quality that we put into our\n(08:56) role-playing games the higher quality we&#x27;re gonna get out of that imagine how awesome a game is going to be if the GM and every player at the table is doing their best to contribute in positive ways in order to make the game as fun as possible for everyone else they don&#x27;t just think of themselves but they consider how can I make this game better for the others sitting here at the table with me now these 10 GM secrets are going to get you off to a great start but what if your game World suffers from a common dilemma it feels lifeless and\n(09:23) boring that is your world doesn&#x27;t feel like a living breathing world if you&#x27;d like to avoid this Pitfall watch this video right here to learn how to make your world&#x27;s vibrant and colorful for both you and your players\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent":

Do things that are unexpected, but don&#x27;t just make it random.\n\n2. **Characters are not the prime movers:** Make your game and world feel larger and grander by placing powerful personages and factions in the world that are working behind the scene. Your player&#x27;s characters are in the spotlight of your game, but they should get the sense that there is more going on in the world than just the adventures they personally undergo.\n\n3. **The importance of a PC backstory:** Characters must know why they are working with the other characters and the reason for that should be baked into each character&#x27;s backstory. This helps the group avoid one of the classic RPG pitfalls: characters who have no reason to work with the other PCs and consequently wander off on their own.\n\n4. **Give your players something to do:** The game master should give the characters options and choices of things they might do. These are your traditional plot hooks that point them toward adventures that they might go on, quests they might undertake, and the like.\n\n5. **Everyone loves a mystery:** Put something mysterious in your world or a handful of mysterious somethings upon which the fate of the world does not depend. Have other Mysteries dotting the game world that your players might come across. These mysteries might lead them on side quests, they might be small curiosities that are investigated and resolved in but a portion of a game session.\n\n6. **Time keeping is not optional:** Timekeeping can add flavor and realism to your campaign, making your game and your world come to life and feel real to players. Keep track of things in the larger world that have nothing to do with the PCs really but that they might hear about and that might indirectly affect what happens around them.\n\n7. **Game prep is paramount:** It&#x27;s better to prepare more than less. Even if you are a masterful GM with decades of experience, your game will be better the more you prep for it.\n\n8. **The world rolls on:** Things happen in the world even if the characters do nothing. Your players should get the feeling that the world around them is moving forward and changing and things are happening, sometimes in response to what they do or don&#x27;t do and sometimes quite independently.\n\n9. **Get Better by doing:** As game Masters, we all want to run awesome games where we and our players have tons of fun. Becoming good at something requires experience, time spent doing that thing, and intentionally trying to improve.\n\n10. **A word on disruptive players:** Remind disruptive players that they will get out of the game session whatever they put into the game session. Everyone at the table should be doing their best to contribute in positive ways in order to make the game as fun as possible for everyone else. They should not just think of themselves but they consider how they can make the game better for the others sitting there at the table with them."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "0d32f227-0160-4162-af27-c6aa753a657b", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "5d72e58f-44b8-4a51-8c57-cb349efd7aa5", "plugin_ids": null, "id": "f96f65ea-5095-4963-9855-611d1a0aeeec"}, {"title": "Front-end Web Design Assistance", "create_time": 1684559627.386984, "update_time": 1684560001.0, "mapping": {"4326c931-66d9-4f15-be14-fb5fc0bed462": {"id": "4326c931-66d9-4f15-be14-fb5fc0bed462", "message": {"id": "4326c931-66d9-4f15-be14-fb5fc0bed462", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684559627.387288, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa13c60-2df7-43c3-880a-f4eec375d16a", "children": ["aaa2d4d3-da7f-41b9-a980-123bdf9502e7"]}, "aaa13c60-2df7-43c3-880a-f4eec375d16a": {"id": "aaa13c60-2df7-43c3-880a-f4eec375d16a", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["4326c931-66d9-4f15-be14-fb5fc0bed462"]}, "aaa2d4d3-da7f-41b9-a980-123bdf9502e7": {"id": "aaa2d4d3-da7f-41b9-a980-123bdf9502e7", "message": {"id": "aaa2d4d3-da7f-41b9-a980-123bdf9502e7", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684559627.467725, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["As an expert in front-end web design, JavaScript development, and Bootstrap v5, help me with my project by providing guidance and answering my questions."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "4326c931-66d9-4f15-be14-fb5fc0bed462", "children": ["dc8ff5c8-723f-41d5-9085-af73d75ac10f"]}, "dc8ff5c8-723f-41d5-9085-af73d75ac10f": {"id": "dc8ff5c8-723f-41d5-9085-af73d75ac10f", "message": {"id": "dc8ff5c8-723f-41d5-9085-af73d75ac10f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684559641.433088, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Of course, I&#x27;d be happy to help you with your project.

I have a few minor suggestions and one fix that&#x27;s needed.\n\nFirst, your HTML is clear and well-structured. It uses Bootstrap classes effectively, and the form controls are correctly labelled. The table structure is also correct.\n\nFor your JavaScript, your usage of `const`, arrow functions, and template literals indicates a solid understanding of ES6.\n\nOne problem I noticed: You have initialized `x` as an object that seems to target elements with IDs &quot;result-level&quot;, &quot;result-concept&quot;, and &quot;result-monsters&quot;. But these IDs don&#x27;t exist in your provided HTML. If you are not using these variables, you can safely remove this declaration.\n\nAs for minor suggestions:\n\n1. **Variable Naming**: While your code works perfectly fine, the variable names `C`, `R`, and `x` are not descriptive. Consider renaming these variables to make your code easier to understand for others (and for you, if you come back to it after some time).\n\n2. **Refactoring Your Event Listeners**: Both of your event listeners query the DOM for elements. You can refactor this by querying the DOM for these elements only once and storing them in variables.\n\nWith these suggestions, your JavaScript would look something like this:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, () =&gt; {\n  const encounterMatrix = { /* Your encounter data here */ };\n  \n  const encounterForm = document.getElementById(&quot;encounter-form&quot;);\n  const partyLevelField = document.getElementById(&quot;party-level&quot;);\n  const encounterConceptField = document.getElementById(&quot;encounter-concept&quot;);\n  const resetBtn = document.getElementById(&quot;reset-btn&quot;);\n  const resultsBody = document.querySelector(&quot;#results tbody&quot;);\n\n  resetBtn.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, () =&gt; {\n    resultsBody.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;;\n  });\n\n  encounterForm.addEventListener(&quot;submit&quot;, (event) =&gt; {\n    event.preventDefault();\n\n    const partyLevel = parseInt(partyLevelField.value);\n    const encounterConcept = encounterConceptField.value;\n    const monsters = encounterMatrix[partyLevel][encounterConcept];\n\n    const newRow = `\n      &lt;tr&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;${partyLevel}&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;${encounterConcept}&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;${monsters}&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\n    `;\n\n    resultsBody.insertAdjacentHTML(&quot;beforeend&quot;, newRow);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nRemember, it&#x27;s always a good practice to write clean, maintainable code. Simple changes like these can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of your code."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2a4c1-d79c-4fcc-9bd7-2ae5376047e8", "children": ["aaa2126a-49f6-46d7-8e7d-fd7e7d7d4e3a", "aaa266e1-df32-4978-a3d9-4cdbae0214e1"]}, "aaa2126a-49f6-46d7-8e7d-fd7e7d7d4e3a": {"id": "aaa2126a-49f6-46d7-8e7d-fd7e7d7d4e3a", "message": {"id": "aaa2126a-49f6-46d7-8e7d-fd7e7d7d4e3a", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684559802.235719, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I new data:\nAverage PC Level\t 1 Monster\t 2 Monsters\t 4 Monsters\t 6 Monsters\t 8 Monsters\t 12 Monsters\t1 Boss +2 Monsters\t  1Boss+3 Monsters\t 1 Boss + 4 Underlings\t 1 Boss + 2 Lieutenants + 8 Minions\n1\t1\t 1/2\t0\t 1/8\t0\t0\t 1/2 + 1/4 (x2)\t 1/2 + 1/8 (x3)\t 0.4 + 0.15 (x4)\t0\n2\t3\t1\t0\t 1/4\t 1/8\t0\t 1 + 1/2 (x2)\t 1 + 1/2 (x3)\t 1 + 0.45 (x4)\t 1/2 + 1/4 (x2) + 0 (x8)\n3\t5\t2\t1\t 1/2\t 1/4\t 1/8\t 2 + 1 (x2)\t 2 + 1/2 (x3)\t 1 + 0.6 (x4)\t 1 + 1/2 (x2) + 1/4 (x8)\n4\t7\t3\t1\t 1/2\t 1/2\t 1/4\t 3 + 1 (x2)\t 3 + 1 (x3)\t 2 + 0.9 (x4)\t 1 + 1/2 (x2) + 1/4 (x8)\n5\t8\t7\t3\t2\t1\t1\t 7 + 4 (x2)\t 7 + 2 (x3)\t 6 + 2 (x4)\t 3 + 1 (x2) + 1/2 (x8)\n6\t10\t9\t4\t2\t2\t1\t 9 + 5 (x2)\t 9 + 3 (x3)\t 7 + 2 (x4)\t 4 + 2 (x2) + 1 (x8)\n7\t12\t10\t5\t3\t2\t1\t 10 + 5 (x2)\t 10 + 3 (x3)\t 8 + 3 (x4)\t 5 + 2 (x2) + 1 (x8)\n8\t14\t12\t6\t3\t3\t1\t 12 + 6 (x2)\t 12 + 4 (x3)\t 9 + 3 (x4)\t 6 + 3 (x2) + 1 (x8)\n9\t15\t13\t6\t4\t3\t2\t 13+7(x2)\t 13+4(x3)\t 10 + 4 (x4)\t 6+3(x2) + 1 (x8)\n10\t17\t15\t7\t4\t3\t2\t 15+8(x2)\t 15+5(x3)\t 12 + 4 (x4)\t 7 + 3 (x2) + 1 (x8)\n11\t19\t16\t8\t5\t4\t3\t 16 + 8 (x2)\t 16 + 5 (x3)\t 13 + 4 (x4)\t 8 + 4 (x2) + 2 (x8)\n12\t21\t18\t9\t5\t5\t3\t 18 + 9 (x2)\t 18 + 6 (x3)\t 14 + 5 (x4)\t 9 + 4 (x2) + 2 (x8)\n13\t22\t19\t9\t6\t5\t3\t 19 + 10 (x2)\t 19 + 7 (x3)\t 15 + 5 (x4)\t 9+4(x2) + 2 (x8)\n14\t24\t21\t10\t6\t6\t4\t 21 + 11 (x2)\t 21 + 7 (x3)\t 16 + 6 (x4)\t 10 + 5 (x2) + 2 (x8)\n15\t26\t22\t11\t7\t6\t4\t 22 + 11 (x2)\t 22 + 8 (x3)\t 18 + 6 (x4)\t 11 + 5 (x2) + 2 (x8)\n16\t28\t24\t12\t7\t7\t4\t 24 + 12 (x2)\t 24 + 8 (x3)\t 19 + 7 (x4)\t 12 + 6 (x2) + 3 (x8)\n17\t30\t25\t17\t12\t9\t6\t 25 + 13 (x2)\t 25 + 9 (x3)\t 20 + 7 (x4)\t 19 + 9 (x2) + 4 (x8)\n18\t30\t27\t18\t13\t10\t6\t 27 + 14 (x2)\t 27 + 9 (x3)\t 21 + 8 (x4)\t 20 + 10 (x2) + 5 (x8)\n19\t30\t28\t19\t14\t10\t7\t 28 + 14 (x2)\t 28 + 10 (x3)\t 22 + 8 (x4)\t 21 + 10 (x2) + 5 (x8)\n20\t30\t30\t20\t14\t11\t7\t 30 + 15 (x2)\t 30 + 10 (x3)\t 24 + 9 (x4)\t 22 + 11 (x2) + 5 (x8)\n\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "c5cf97fc-e47b-4dda-980d-08806a12a481", "children": ["057359f7-e063-4953-9f47-9486a2b549ec"]}, "057359f7-e063-4953-9f47-9486a2b549ec": {"id": "057359f7-e063-4953-9f47-9486a2b549ec", "message": {"id": "057359f7-e063-4953-9f47-9486a2b549ec", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684559825.262806, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["This table seems to represent encounter balance data for a tabletop role-playing game, possibly Dungeons and Dragons or a similar system. \n\nThe rows indicate the average level of the player characters (PCs) in the party.

By looking for other Disney musical films, you can find movies with a similar style. Some examples include &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; &quot;Aladdin,&quot; &quot;The Lion King,&quot; &quot;Pocahontas,&quot; &quot;Mulan,&quot; &quot;Frozen,&quot; and &quot;Frozen II.&quot;\n\n2. **Look at the Songwriters and Composers**: The style of songs in a movie is largely influenced by the people who wrote and composed them. For instance, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Opetaia Foa&#x27;i, and Mark Mancina were the songwriters for Moana. If you look for other movies where they were involved, you&#x27;re likely to find similar styles of music. For example, Lin-Manuel Miranda also worked on the music for &quot;Encanto&quot; and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; live-action movie.\n\n3. **Disney Movies with Original Songs**: Many Disney films feature original songs written specifically for the movie. These films often have a more traditional musical style. Look for Disney films that have won or been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\n4. **Check out Disney Princess Movies**: The Disney Princess line of films often features more traditional musical numbers. Movies like &quot;Cinderella,&quot; &quot;Sleeping Beauty,&quot; &quot;The Princess and the Frog,&quot; &quot;Tangled,&quot; and &quot;Brave&quot; all have songs that are more sing-along and less rock and roll.\n\n5. **Research Online**: There are many blogs, articles, and fan sites that discuss Disney music and could provide recommendations for movies with a similar musical style to Moana.\n\nIf you want to find recent movies with similar music to Moana, I can use the browser tool to search online for recommendations. Would you like me to do that?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2bd94-2be5-4164-bc79-e614154fb11c", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "209fdb2a-2225-47b7-b5b8-a2952147df41", "plugin_ids": null, "id": "49886446-6b99-4593-bb7f-a957915a7569"}, {"title": "&quot;Unlocking DND Difficulty Class&quot;", "create_time": 1684296312.038228, "update_time": 1684296526.0, "mapping": {"0b8c4255-d6ae-4f3a-99d6-847e91b0f27d": {"id": "0b8c4255-d6ae-4f3a-99d6-847e91b0f27d", "message": {"id": "c184e21e-e4ee-484a-bb5d-38dd903c9a21", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684296524.900379, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa189bd-dcb2-4cb9-89f4-3964676dbd6d", "children": ["aaa290f8-ef05-4763-bc67-3f5a1462640f"]}, "aaa189bd-dcb2-4cb9-89f4-3964676dbd6d": {"id": "aaa189bd-dcb2-4cb9-89f4-3964676dbd6d", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["0b8c4255-d6ae-4f3a-99d6-847e91b0f27d"]}, "aaa290f8-ef05-4763-bc67-3f5a1462640f": {"id": "aaa290f8-ef05-4763-bc67-3f5a1462640f", "message": {"id": "aaa290f8-ef05-4763-bc67-3f5a1462640f", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684296312.042317, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Summarize the following in 5 bullet points.\nTitle: &quot;The SECRET NUMBER Every GM NEEDS to Know!

impossible 30. but why would a moderate task be 15 why wouldn&#x27;t it be a 10 or an 11 that&#x27;s a round of 50 percent chance of succeeding the answer is 5e characters have such incredible bonuses in Advanced Dungeons and Dragons if you had an 18 strength you&#x27;d get plus one to hit 5e characters are all swole with plus four to hit so the designers have adjusted the difficulty classes upwards to compensate which is a lot like spinal tap setting their amplifiers to 11 but I digress always remember the numbers on the character sheets aren&#x27;t real all that is real are the 20 sides on this die and you can&#x27;t roll a 30. if a character has a 20 perception and you set the difficulty class for spotting something at 30 what you&#x27;re really saying is look your car Parker may be an expert at spotting stuff but this black pudding is very difficult to spot you need to roll a 10 or better to see it bonuses are an illusion for the players to make them think their characters are awesome and the game master is being fair and not making arbitrary decisions the most common comment I receive on my hacking videos is well Professor if you do that the game becomes just arbitrary which is ridiculous because the entire game is arbitrary why are hobgoblins Armor class 18 because some Seattle hipster said so this this is why we weren&#x27;t invited to that Wizard&#x27;s Creator Summit why you trust their decision making over your own friends about monsters that don&#x27;t even exist I don&#x27;t know but they do know how to set difficulty classes so let&#x27;s move on the Wizards of Seattle have decided the average ability score standard array is 15 14 13 12 10 8. but who are we kidding every player will choose a species or a feet that Buffs their Prime requisite ability score to 16 or 17 and we can discard the those 3 to 18 ability scores they are meaningless only the pluses count so the actual standard array is plus three plus two plus one plus one zero minus one right wrong because then the players get a proficiency bonus which is used primarily in conjunction with their Prime requisite ability score Fighters use their proficiency bonus in conjunction with strength to fight stuff Rogues use their proficiency bonus with dexterity to sneak up on people and pick locks and disarm traps which is why in my game debt bringer you just add plus two to your favorite ability score all characters in DND begin at plus five sometimes plus six to whatever ability they&#x27;re best at but put a pin in that and let&#x27;s flip to page 274 of the 5e DMG and a section called creating quick monster stats this is the formula the designers use to come up with monsters notice the armor class for challenge rating 0 to 3 is 13. cr4 is 14. cr5 is Armor class 15. as the CIA ER goes up so do the ACs and that AC increases parallel with the characters proficiency bonus creating the Illusion for the players that their characters are improving so let&#x27;s accept armor glass 13 is the most common difficulty class in the game after all players spend most of their time fighting 13 minus the fighters plus five bonus is eight but what about the Rogue well they&#x27;re going to be using a ranger to finesse weapon which works with their dexterity and they also get plus five to hit bringing their target number to eight if the character had an 18 inch strength their dexterity the target number would be seven but the most common number in D and D the secret number is eight consider this eight is a 65 chance of success and that kind of feels right the characters are supposed to be heroes right they&#x27;re supposed to be experts it&#x27;s no fun to miss all the time you want to hit and succeed more than you fail but not all the time so the game is born boring a 65 success rate feels satisfying DND is played in an average range of 7 to 14 and the DC&#x27;s come in three bands seven eight are the expert characters nine to eleven are not quite experts but they&#x27;re still skill that&#x27;s like a cleric rolling to hit at 13 to 14 would be the target number for non-skilled characters so the next time your players forget their character sheet or d d Beyond crashes don&#x27;t freak out Ned Nimble fingers is a rogue Ned needs eight to pick the lock and it doesn&#x27;t much matter what level net is a 10 level fighter faces off against an adult green dragon armor class 19. that&#x27;s tough but by 10th level they buff their strength to plus four and have a plus four proficiency bonus and a plus three magic sword that&#x27;s plus 11 to hit Armor class 19. oh yeah it&#x27;s an eight but what about adjusting for high armor classes or more challenging traps to disarm index card RPG has a great mechanic called hard and easy anything that&#x27;s hard you raise the difficulty be classed by plus three and anything that&#x27;s easy you lower the difficulty class by minus three why three because mathematically that&#x27;s what you get when you roll advantage or disadvantage so you can eliminate that mechanic and just say easy hard plus or minus three a boss monster might be hard to hit so the fighter needs an 11 instead of an eight still a fifty percent chance a weak foe like a goblin might be five to hit an eighty percent chance of success and that kind of makes sense I like osr gaming but I always found the armor classes are a bit too high I&#x27;m rereading the lost city in preparation for running it soon and it&#x27;s great but I noticed that every Giant Beetle and Goblin has an armor class of 14. that&#x27;s a bit too high I always felt that old school games should lower the armor classes by about three otherwise it&#x27;s too much whiffing and that can be really frustrating for players as combat&#x27;s dragged on and on with neither side Landing a blow another comment I get is Professor I like your ideas but my players aren&#x27;t going to go for them put them master in dungeon master and when they go to roll the dice just say I&#x27;ve made all the calculations Roland eight and if they do the calculations and they find the target number is actually higher than the one you set they&#x27;re going to quickly change their tune and just go with your gut instincts so remember when setting those difficulty classes if the character is an expert it is a seven or an eight and if they&#x27;re moderately skilled it&#x27;s something like a 10 or 11. at least that&#x27;s what I think I&#x27;d love to hear what you think in the comments below also below you&#x27;ll find links to dungeographed on Facebook and patreon where you can get extra content and my own games debt bringer and Eldritch hack at drive through RPG thanks for watching I&#x27;ll see you soon may all your rules be twenties so deathbringer you&#x27;re still blaming me for us not getting invited to that Wizard&#x27;s influencer Summit yes now I&#x27;m never going to Seattle what did I said it was so bad any of these thumbnails ring a bell alright what about your tabaxi skin rug collection that was self-defense and they backed into my ax tell you what I&#x27;ll buy you a Starbucks and we can drink it in the rain then at least feel like we&#x27;re in Seattle all right it&#x27;s better than nothing in the meantime get my game a drive-through and watch more dungeon craft [Music]&quot;\n"]}, "status":

Their first task was to meet Loralai, a Harper agent, at a small, unassuming tavern called the Wandering Wyvern.\n\nIn the shadowy corner of the tavern, they found Loralai, who revealed that the Cult was using the Underdark to move its forces and gather resources for their dark ritual. Loralai presented the party with a Compass of Underdark Navigation, a magical artifact that would guide them through the treacherous underground realm.\n\nArmed with this information, the adventurers set out to gather supplies for the journey ahead. Waterdeep&#x27;s vast array of shops, markets, and other resources offered plenty of opportunities for the party to purchase equipment, potions, scrolls, and other items that would aid them in their quest.\n\nAs they made their way through the busy streets, they were suddenly ambushed by a group of Cult members, including three Cult Fanatics and two Cult Assassins. The ensuing combat took place in a crowded city street, with buildings and bystanders providing cover and obstacles. The adventurers had to use their abilities creatively while being mindful of potential collateral damage.\n\nAfter defeating the Cult members, the party interrogated one of the captured Cultists. They learned that the Cult had a secret meeting place in Waterdeep where they planned their activities. Reluctantly, the Cultist provided the party with the location of the hideout.\n\nApproaching a nondescript building in a narrow alley, the adventurers found the Cult&#x27;s secret meeting place. Inside, they navigated the hideout, dealing with traps, locked doors, and potential combat encounters with Cult members. They used stealth, deception, or brute force to overcome the challenges they faced.\n\nThe party&#x27;s rewards included not only treasure from defeated enemies but also valuable experience and information from overcoming the challenges in Waterdeep. They discovered a list of key Cult members, detailed maps of the Underdark, and further information about the dark ritual within the Cult&#x27;s hideout.\n\nWith the Compass of Underdark Navigation and the additional information about the Cult&#x27;s activities, the adventurers were now prepared to venture forth to Thornhold. From there, they would enter the Mere of Dead Men and seek the entrance to the Underdark. The journey ahead promised danger and uncertainty, but the party knew they must press on to stop the Cult and prevent the rise of the dracolich Dauergothoth.\n\nSecrets and Clues\n\n  1. A group of bandits is secretly working for the Cult to sabotage the party&#x27;s journey.\n  2. An ancient elven ruin along the road contains a hidden cache of magical items.\n  3. A traveling bard knows a prophetic song about the rise of the dracolich.\n  4. A powerful storm that slows the party&#x27;s travel has been magically conjured by the Cult.\n  5. A reclusive hermit living in the wilderness has witnessed Cult activity in the area.\n\n### Encounter 1: Meeting the Harper Agent (Roleplay)\n\n### \u201cAs you enter the bustling city of Waterdeep, you make your way to the agreed-upon meeting spot: a small, unassuming tavern called the Wandering Wyvern.

The information is organized in a way that makes it easy for the DM to follow and present to players\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. The use of established lore, such as the Cult of the Dragon, Harper agents, and the Underdark, helps to ground the adventure in the Forgotten Realms setting. This can enhance player immersion and make the world feel more cohesive and believable\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. The narrative includes a good balance of roleplay, exploration, and combat encounters. This balance helps to cater to different player preferences and keep the session varied and engaging\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4.

The detailed description of the first encounter with the Harper agent sets the stage well for roleplay and provides a clear objective for the party\u30108\u2020source\u3011.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. It could be beneficial to provide a bit more detail for the combat encounters. For example, the ambush by Cult members in the city streets has potential for a dynamic and memorable fight, but could benefit from more detailed descriptions of the environment, enemy tactics, and possible complications.\n\n2. It would be useful to flesh out the Harper agent, Loralai, a bit more. As a key NPC in this session, providing more details about her personality, appearance, and motivations could help the DM bring her to life during the session.\n\n3. The section on the Cult&#x27;s secret hideout could be expanded with more specific information about the layout, traps, and enemies present. This could help the DM run this part of the session more smoothly.\n\n4. The &quot;Secrets and Clues&quot; section could be expanded to provide specific ways that the party might discover these pieces of information. This could include potential NPC interactions, locations to explore, or skill checks to make.\n\nOverall, these session notes form a strong basis for an engaging and exciting D&amp;D session.

Their first task was to meet Loralai, a Harper agent, at a small, unassuming tavern called the Wandering Wyvern.\n\nIn the shadowy corner of the tavern, they found Loralai, who revealed that the Cult was using the Underdark to move its forces and gather resources for their dark ritual. Loralai presented the party with a Compass of Underdark Navigation, a magical artifact that would guide them through the treacherous underground realm.\n\nArmed with this information, the adventurers set out to gather supplies for the journey ahead. Waterdeep&#x27;s vast array of shops, markets, and other resources offered plenty of opportunities for the party to purchase equipment, potions, scrolls, and other items that would aid them in their quest.\n\nAs they made their way through the busy streets, they were suddenly ambushed by a group of Cult members, including three Cult Fanatics and two Cult Assassins. The ensuing combat took place in a crowded city street, with buildings and bystanders providing cover and obstacles. The adventurers had to use their abilities creatively while being mindful of potential collateral damage.\n\nAfter defeating the Cult members, the party interrogated one of the captured Cultists. They learned that the Cult had a secret meeting place in Waterdeep where they planned their activities. Reluctantly, the Cultist provided the party with the location of the hideout.\n\nApproaching a nondescript building in a narrow alley, the adventurers found the Cult&#x27;s secret meeting place. Inside, they navigated the hideout, dealing with traps, locked doors, and potential combat encounters with Cult members. They used stealth, deception, or brute force to overcome the challenges they faced.\n\nThe party&#x27;s rewards included not only treasure from defeated enemies but also valuable experience and information from overcoming the challenges in Waterdeep. They discovered a list of key Cult members, detailed maps of the Underdark, and further information about the dark ritual within the Cult&#x27;s hideout.\n\nWith the Compass of Underdark Navigation and the additional information about the Cult&#x27;s activities, the adventurers were now prepared to venture forth to Thornhold. From there, they would enter the Mere of Dead Men and seek the entrance to the Underdark. The journey ahead promised danger and uncertainty, but the party knew they must press on to stop the Cult and prevent the rise of the dracolich Dauergothoth.\n\nSecrets and Clues\n\n  1. A group of bandits is secretly working for the Cult to sabotage the party&#x27;s journey.\n  2. An ancient elven ruin along the road contains a hidden cache of magical items.\n  3. A traveling bard knows a prophetic song about the rise of the dracolich.\n  4. A powerful storm that slows the party&#x27;s travel has been magically conjured by the Cult.\n  5. A reclusive hermit living in the wilderness has witnessed Cult activity in the area.\n\n### Encounter 1: Meeting the Harper Agent (Roleplay)\n\n### \u201cAs you enter the bustling city of Waterdeep, you make your way to the agreed-upon meeting spot: a small, unassuming tavern called the Wandering Wyvern. Inside, you find a hooded figure waiting in a shadowy corner.\u201d\n\nThe hooded figure is the Harper agent, Loralai. She reveals that the Cult of the Dragon is using the Underdark to move its forces and gather resources for the dark ritual. Loralai presents the party with a magical artifact: a Compass of Underdark Navigation, which will guide them through the Underdark when the time comes.\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "pub_date": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "quote", "args": ["Approaching a nondescript building in a", "overcome the challenges they faced."], "status": "finished", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "3880d7a7-96b4-4a81-947b-e7f99da502cf", "children": ["eacadfb5-52dc-456c-b6ea-69f75686e799"]}, "eacadfb5-52dc-456c-b6ea-69f75686e799": {"id": "eacadfb5-52dc-456c-b6ea-69f75686e799", "message": {"id": "eacadfb5-52dc-456c-b6ea-69f75686e799", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684212682.415043, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["**Encounter 3: The Cult&#x27;s Secret Hideout**\n\n- Encounter Type, Location, and Key NPCs or Monsters: Exploration and potential combat, Cult&#x27;s hideout in Waterdeep, Cult members\n- Read-aloud text: &quot;You stand before a nondescript building nestled within a narrow alley.

If they fail, they will trigger the traps and take damage.\n\n**Puzzle Description and Solution:** Not applicable.\n\n**Boss Encounter:** Not applicable."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa21882-b449-44da-8f09-e2ed8ae95661", "children": ["aaa2af8b-6d86-419e-a19f-29a240925e7e", "aaa25225-eea3-419e-9584-fb2dd2141344"]}, "aaa2af8b-6d86-419e-a19f-29a240925e7e": {"id": "aaa2af8b-6d86-419e-a19f-29a240925e7e", "message": {"id": "aaa2af8b-6d86-419e-a19f-29a240925e7e", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684251746.229705, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Now lets work on your Areas for Improvement from above."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "75bf07fb-d035-4d75-9e6a-8fb8010506c9", "children": ["50d664f2-cae5-44dd-a1ce-da2437458513"]}, "50d664f2-cae5-44dd-a1ce-da2437458513": {"id": "50d664f2-cae5-44dd-a1ce-da2437458513", "message": {"id": "50d664f2-cae5-44dd-a1ce-da2437458513", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684251756.852472, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sure, I&#x27;d be happy to refine the adventure further based on any feedback or areas for improvement you&#x27;ve identified.

However, it could benefit from more detailed descriptions and motivations for these characters. For example, what does Loralai look like? What&#x27;s her demeanor? Why is she helping the party? Similarly, what distinguishes the Cult Fanatics from the Assassins? Providing more detail about these characters would make them more memorable and engaging for the players.\n\n2. **Encounter Balance:** The encounter with the Cult members in the city streets seems quite challenging, with three Cult Fanatics and two Cult Assassins. Depending on the level of the party, this might be a deadly encounter. It could be helpful to provide some guidance for adjusting the difficulty of this encounter based on the party&#x27;s level and size.\n\n3. **Connection to the Larger Plot:** The adventure does a good job of tying the session to the larger plot of stopping the Cult of the Dragon and preventing the rise of the dracolich Dauergothoth. However, it could be helpful to highlight this connection more explicitly throughout the session. For example, when the party finds the maps of the Underdark and the list of Cult members, emphasize how this information brings them one step closer to their ultimate goal.\n\n4. **Roleplay Opportunities:** The session already includes some great opportunities for roleplay, such as the meeting with Loralai and the interrogation of the captured Cultist. However, it could benefit from even more opportunities for the players to engage with the world and its characters. For instance, when the party is gathering supplies in Waterdeep, consider introducing some colorful shopkeepers or street vendors for the players to interact with.\n\nLet&#x27;s work on these areas for improvement."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa25225-eea3-419e-9584-fb2dd2141344", "children": ["aaa2daaf-9826-4afa-bd46-597861771818"]}, "aaa2daaf-9826-4afa-bd46-597861771818": {"id": "aaa2daaf-9826-4afa-bd46-597861771818", "message": {"id": "aaa2daaf-9826-4afa-bd46-597861771818", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684251972.790775, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["continue"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "a89810c2-0c0d-4aa6-9e30-df2156ebf04d", "children": ["fe20494a-7e6e-43b3-909b-9481afbbcfb6"]}, "fe20494a-7e6e-43b3-909b-9481afbbcfb6": {"id": "fe20494a-7e6e-43b3-909b-9481afbbcfb6", "message": {"id": "fe20494a-7e6e-43b3-909b-9481afbbcfb6", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684252054.764686, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Let&#x27;s start with the first area for improvement: **NPCs and Monsters**.\n\nIn the current notes, Loralai, the Harper agent, is introduced but not much is given about her character, motivations, or appearance. Here&#x27;s a more detailed description:\n\nLoralai is a middle-aged half-elf with a stern demeanor. Her long, silver hair is usually tied up in a complex braid, and she wears the simple, functional attire of a seasoned adventurer, including a cloak with the Harper&#x27;s pin subtly attached. Loralai is a dedicated member of the Harpers, motivated by a deep-seated desire to maintain balance in the world. She lost her family to the destructive whims of a rogue wizard, and ever since, she has committed her life to prevent such wanton misuse of power. Loralai is direct and no-nonsense, but she also has a dry wit and appreciates clever thinking.\n\nAs for the Cult Fanatics and Cult Assassins, they could be distinguished by their attire and demeanor. The Fanatics are wild-eyed and fervent, shouting praises to the dracolich Dauergothoth as they fight. They wear the cult&#x27;s colors boldly and openly, caring little for subtlety. On the other hand, the Assassins are cold and methodical, preferring to strike from the shadows. They wear more subdued clothing, with the cult&#x27;s symbols cleverly hidden.\n\nNext, we&#x27;ll address the second area for improvement: **Encounter Balance**.\n\nThe ambush in the city streets could indeed be quite challenging for a lower-level party. To adjust this, the Dungeon Master (DM) could consider reducing the number of enemies based on the party&#x27;s level and size. For instance, if the party consists of only three low-level characters, the encounter could be scaled down to two Fanatics and one Assassin. Conversely, if the party is larger or higher level, additional enemies or higher-level enemies could be added. The DM should keep in mind the party&#x27;s resources and overall condition at this point in the session, as this encounter should be challenging but not overwhelming.\n\nI&#x27;ll address the remaining areas for improvement in the next message."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2daaf-9826-4afa-bd46-597861771818", "children": ["aaa2961f-9562-4900-99d7-e1e5714a7515", "aaa2eceb-0906-40e3-a4c1-13d1d381628c"]}, "aaa2961f-9562-4900-99d7-e1e5714a7515": {"id": "aaa2961f-9562-4900-99d7-e1e5714a7515", "message": {"id": "aaa2961f-9562-4900-99d7-e1e5714a7515", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684252063.071884, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["You are an expert in Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, including the SRD5.1, all published adventures, sourcebooks, and monsters.

Here are some enhanced descriptions:\n\n- **Entrance Hall**: This dimly lit hall smells of damp stone and old parchment. The walls are adorned with fading tapestries depicting dragons in various stages of life, from hatching to full-grown majesty. A large wooden door at the other end of the hall is secured with a heavy iron padlock.\n\n- **Meeting Room**: The meeting room is a large, circular space with a long, dark-wood table at its center, surrounded by ornately carved chairs. The table is cluttered with maps, scrolls, and various other documents, some marked with symbols recognizable as those of the Cult of the Dragon. A large chandelier, studded with faintly glowing purple crystals, hangs from the ceiling.\n\n- **Armory**: This room is filled with racks of weapons and armor, all bearing the dragon symbol of the Cult. It&#x27;s clear that the Cult is well-equipped and prepared for conflict. Among the mundane equipment, a careful search may reveal a couple of magical items, such as a Dagger of Venom and a Shield of Missile Attraction.\n\nLastly, we&#x27;ll look at the fourth area for improvement: **DM Guidance**.\n\nFor new DMs, it can be helpful to include notes about how to handle certain situations or decisions that might arise during the session. For example:\n\n- **Dealing with Failure**: If the party fails to extract information from the captured Cultist, provide alternative ways for them to discover the hideout&#x27;s location. Perhaps a nearby bystander saw the Cultists&#x27; escape route, or the party finds a coded message on one of the Cultists that, when deciphered, reveals the location.\n\n- **Player Choices**: Be prepared for players to take unexpected actions. If they decide to, say, stake out the meeting location rather than going in immediately, let them. Develop the world and the NPCs&#x27; actions around their decisions.\n\n- **Combat**: During the city ambush, remember to use the environment to the enemies&#x27; advantage. The assassins might use the crowd as cover, while the fanatics could try to use the chaos to their advantage. Encourage your players to think creatively about using the environment as well.\n\nI hope these improvements enhance the session and make it easier for new DMs to run.

Their first task was to meet Loralai, a Harper agent, at a small, unassuming tavern called the Wandering Wyvern.\n\nIn the shadowy corner of the tavern, they found Loralai, who revealed that the Cult was using the Underdark to move its forces and gather resources for their dark ritual. Loralai presented the party with a Compass of Underdark Navigation, a magical artifact that would guide them through the treacherous underground realm.\n\nArmed with this information, the adventurers set out to gather supplies for the journey ahead. Waterdeep&#x27;s vast array of shops, markets, and other resources offered plenty of opportunities for the party to purchase equipment, potions, scrolls, and other items that would aid them in their quest.\n\nAs they made their way through the busy streets, they were suddenly ambushed by a group of Cult members, including three Cult Fanatics and two Cult Assassins. The ensuing combat took place in a crowded city street, with buildings and bystanders providing cover and obstacles. The adventurers had to use their abilities creatively while being mindful of potential collateral damage.\n\nAfter defeating the Cult members, the party interrogated one of the captured Cultists. They learned that the Cult had a secret meeting place in Waterdeep where they planned their activities. Reluctantly, the Cultist provided the party with the location of the hideout.\n\nApproaching a nondescript building in a narrow alley, the adventurers found the Cult&#x27;s secret meeting place. Inside, they navigated the hideout, dealing with traps, locked doors, and potential combat encounters with Cult members. They used stealth, deception, or brute force to overcome the challenges they faced.\n\nThe party&#x27;s rewards included not only treasure from defeated enemies but also valuable experience and information from overcoming the challenges in Waterdeep. They discovered a list of key Cult members, detailed maps of the Underdark, and further information about the dark ritual within the Cult&#x27;s hideout.\n\nWith the Compass of Underdark Navigation and the additional information about the Cult&#x27;s activities, the adventurers were now prepared to venture forth to Thornhold. From there, they would enter the Mere of Dead Men and seek the entrance to the Underdark. The journey ahead promised danger and uncertainty, but the party knew they must press on to stop the Cult and prevent the rise of the dracolich Dauergothoth.\n\nSecrets and Clues\n\n  1. A group of bandits is secretly working for the Cult to sabotage the party&#x27;s journey.\n  2. An ancient elven ruin along the road contains a hidden cache of magical items.\n  3. A traveling bard knows a prophetic song about the rise of the dracolich.\n  4. A powerful storm that slows the party&#x27;s travel has been magically conjured by the Cult.\n  5. A reclusive hermit living in the wilderness has witnessed Cult activity in the area.\n\n### Encounter 1: Meeting the Harper Agent (Roleplay)\n\n### \u201cAs you enter the bustling city of Waterdeep, you make your way to the agreed-upon meeting spot: a small, unassuming tavern called the Wandering Wyvern.

They lost the blessings bestowed upon them by the gods and could not progress within the organization as a whole. Only by the blessing of the Master Harpers could an agent be reinstated, and only after demonstrating proper \u3010179\u2020atonement\u3011.\u3010180\u2020[6]\u3011\n\n## Abilities[]\n\nLike the storytellers and traveling musicians who traveled from one town to the next, Harper agents were quite skilled at acquiring new lore about the world around them. While most of this information was seemingly random and occasionally esoteric, it could often prove to be quite useful.\u3010150\u2020[2]\u3011\u3010181\u2020[7]\u3011\n\nHarper agents were trained to be very resourceful and they often learned how to manipulate others into believing they should be considered allies.\u3010182\u2020[8]\u3011\n\nThroughout their careers, agents often picked up divine boons associated with the \u3010183\u2020deities\u3011 who looked favorably upon the Harpers. These powers that affected agents of the Harpers were:\u3010150\u2020[2]\u3011\u3010181\u2020[7]\u3011\n\n  * \u3010184\u2020Lliira\u3011&#x27;s abundant joy allowed them to face down frightful situations.\n  * Through the wisdom of \u3010185\u2020Deneir\u3011, they were often able to avoid harmful runes or \u3010186\u2020glyphs\u3011.\n  * The empathy of \u3010187\u2020Lurue\u3011 opened up lines of communication between agents and wild animals.\n  * The luck of \u3010188\u2020Tymora\u3011 always seemed to smile upon them at the most opportune times.\n  * \u3010189\u2020Mystra\u3011 herself offered protection against harmful \u3010190\u2020magic\u3011.\n\nTrue to their name, many Harper agents honed their skills as crafters of \u3010191\u2020musical instruments\u3011. Similarly, many of their ranks took up \u3010192\u2020alchemy\u3011 in the form of learning how to mix and brew \u3010193\u2020potions\u3011.\u3010180\u2020[6]\u3011\n\n## Possessions[]\n\nThe agents of the Harpers were readily identifiable, when they chose to be, by their \u3010194\u2020namesake pins\u3011.\u3010180\u2020[6]\u3011 While these appeared to be mere trinkets, they were strong \u3010190\u2020magical\u3011 items and a symbol of great significance recognized throughout the Realms.\u3010182\u2020[8]\u3011\n\n## Relationships[]\n\nBecause they spent most of their time out on missions, agents had a knack for making enemies among those organizations that regularly clashed with the Harpers. Individual members often became quite skilled at specifically working against one or two of these groups over time.\u3010150\u2020[2]\u3011\n\nAmong these favored enemies of the Harpers in the 14^{th} century were the \u3010195\u2020Cult of the Dragon\u3011, the often-similarly-aligned \u3010196\u2020church of Bane\u3011 and the \u3010197\u2020Zhentarim\u3011, and even the \u3010198\u2020Red\nVisible: 39% - 71%", "summary": " (forgottenrealms.fandom.com)\n"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"title": "", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Harper_agent", "text": " *  by year  \n      *  by Realm year  \n\n    *  Video games  \n\n      *  by series  \n\n    *  Comics  \n\n      *  by series  \n\n    *  Magazines  \n\n      *  Dragon  \n      *  Dungeon  \n      *  Polyhedron  \n      *  Dragon+  \n\n    *  Card games  \n\n      *  AD&amp;D Trading Cards  \n      *  Battle for Baldur&#x27;s Gate  \n      *  Spellfire  \n      *  The Great Khan Game  \n      *  Blood Wars  \n\n    *  Board games  \n\n  *  Help  \n\n    *  What is canon?  \n    *  Policies &amp; Guidelines  \n\n      *  Blocking  \n      *  Plagiarism &amp; Copyright Infringement  \n      *  Past-tense  \n      *  Other policies  \n\n    *  Creating articles  \n    *  Editing  \n    *  Using templates  \n    *  Using categories  \n    *  The admin staff  \n\n  *  Community  \n\n    *  Discussion  \n\n      *  Forum  \n      *  Recent blog posts  \n\n    *  Features  \n\n      *  Current clack  \n      *  Featured articles  \n      *  Good articles  \n      *  Latest releases  \n      *  New pages  \n      *  Lunar calendar  \n      *  Browse categories  \n      *  Make a request  \n\n    *  Other Languages  \n\n      *  Forgotten Realms (Arabic)  \n      *  Faer\u00fbnpedia (German)  \n      *  Wiki Reinos Olvidados (Spanish)  \n      *  Wiki dos Reinos Esquecidos (Portuguese)  \n      *  Faerun Wiki (Polish)  \n      *  Forgotten Realms (Finnish)  \n      *  Wiki Le Monde des Royaumes Oubli\u00e9s (French)  \n      *  \u0417\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0438 (Russian)  \n\n    *  Gamepedia Gaming hub  \n\n  \n\nin: Harper agents, Harper agents (3e), Prestige classes, \n\nand 2 more\n\n  * Classes of the Harpers \n  * Classes \n\n#  Harper agent\n\n  Edit  \n\n  *  Edit source  \n  *  View history  \n  *  Talk (2)  \n\n  * 1479 DR \n  * 1372 DR \n\n  \n\n  \n\nVarious Harper Agents\n\n## Harper Agent  \n(Harper Scout)\n\n### Abbreviation\n\nHrp[1]\n\n### Affiliation\n\nHarpers[2]\n\n## Class Statistics\n\n  * 3e \n\n## 3rd Edition Statistics[2][3]\n\nPrestige class Requirements\n\n### Alignment\n\nLG NG CG  \nLN N CN  \nLE NE CE  \n\n### Other\n\nSome experience with diplomacy and negotiation, knowledge about their Realm and its landscape, the ability to read others, sponsorship by a Harper member\n\nList of known harper agents Harper agents, also known as Harper scouts,[note 1][4] were those members of the semi-secret organization known as the Harpers who carried out missions of surveillance, reconnaissance, and infiltration.

They were considered the field agents of the organization and could be found throughout a number of Realms, all across Faer\u00fbn.[2][3]\n\n\u201c\n\n&quot;You fight for your freedom? Well, I fight for the freedom of all&quot;\n\n\u201d\n\n\u2014 An agent of the Harpers[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Culture \n    * 1.1 Membership\n  * 2 Abilities\n  * 3 Possessions\n  * 4 Relationships\n  * 5 History\n  * 6 Notable Harper Agents &amp; Scouts\n  * 7 Appendix \n    * 7.1 See also\n    * 7.2 Notes\n    * 7.3 Appearances\n    * 7.4 External links\n    * 7.5 References\n\n## Culture[]\n\nLike all their fellow Harpers, scouts were dedicated to three major tenets: to keep the balance between the natural world and civilized societies, to maintain and safeguard all manner of lore regarding the Realms, and act out against those who brought about evil into the world.[2][3] Their strong sense of morality was one of their most critical traits.[5]\n\nThey were a capable and versatile lot, each of whom could carry out a solo mission or conspire with their allies to successfully carry out the Harpers&#x27; goals.[3]\n\n### Membership[]\n\nIn order to become an agent, an individual had to be sponsored by a Harper in good standing and gain approval of the High Harpers.[2][3]\n\nAny member who failed to uphold the code of the Harpers was quickly turned away by their fellow members. They lost the blessings bestowed upon them by the gods and could not progress within the organization as a whole. Only by the blessing of the Master Harpers could an agent be reinstated, and only after demonstrating proper atonement.[6]\n\n## Abilities[]\n\nLike the storytellers and traveling musicians who traveled from one town to the next, Harper agents were quite skilled at acquiring new lore about the world around them. While most of this information was seemingly random and occasionally esoteric, it could often prove to be quite useful.[2][7]\n\nHarper agents were trained to be very resourceful and they often learned how to manipulate others into believing they should be considered allies.[8]\n\nThroughout their careers, agents often picked up divine boons associated with the deities who looked favorably upon the Harpers. These powers that affected agents of the Harpers were:[2][7]\n\n  * Lliira&#x27;s abundant joy allowed them to face down frightful situations.\n  * Through the wisdom of Deneir, they were often able to avoid harmful runes or glyphs.\n  * The empathy of Lurue opened up lines of communication between agents and wild animals.\n  * The luck of Tymora always seemed to smile upon them at the most opportune times.\n  * Mystra herself offered protection against harmful magic.\n\nTrue to their name, many Harper agents honed their skills as crafters of musical instruments.

Their belief was that dracoliches were destined to one day rule Faer\u00fbn and beyond and that it was their purpose to help this come to pass.[1][2][4][5][6][8][9][12][13] They were considered to be a secret society[2][3][4] or a beast cult, albeit an overly large and powerful one,[3][4][14] and as a mercantile and criminal enterprise.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Dogma \n    * 1.1 Sammaster&#x27;s Teachings\n    * 1.2 Silrajin&#x27;s Teachings\n  * 2 Organization \n    * 2.1 Membership\n    * 2.2 Recruitment\n  * 3 Requirements \n    * 3.1 Cells\n    * 3.2 Hierarchy\n    * 3.3 Leadership\n    * 3.4 Classes\n  * 4 Activities \n    * 4.1 Serving Dragons\n    * 4.2 Magic\n    * 4.3 Construction\n    * 4.4 Fundraising\n    * 4.5 Combat\n  * 5 Symbols &amp; Signs\n  * 6 Tactics\n  * 7 Bases of Operations \n    * 7.1 Regions \n      * 7.1.1 The Well of Dragons\n      * 7.1.2 Dragon Coast\n      * 7.1.3 Dalelands\n      * 7.1.4 Cormyr\n      * 7.1.5 Lands of Intrigue\n      * 7.1.6 Mourktar\n      * 7.1.7 Murgh\u00f4m\n      * 7.1.8 Neverwinter\n      * 7.1.9 Sembia\n      * 7.1.10 Tymanther\n      * 7.1.11 Waterdeep\n      * 7.1.12 Moonsea\n    * 7.2 Other Cells\n  * 8 Relationships\n  * 9 Reputation\n  * 10 Abilities\n  * 11 Magic \n    * 11.1 Ritual of Ascension\n    * 11.2 Spells\n  * 12 Possessions \n    * 12.1 Dress\n    * 12.2 Weapons\n    * 12.3 Armor\n    * 12.4 Magical Items\n    * 12.5 Artifacts\n  * 13 History\n  * 14 Appendix \n    * 14.1 Appearances\n    * 14.2 Further Reading\n    * 14.3 References\n\n## Dogma[]\n\n### Sammaster&#x27;s Teachings[]\n\n\u201c\n\nAnd naught will be left save shattered thrones with no rulers.

To Dorian, she says, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard of your misfortune, Dorian. It is my hope that this mission can assist you in reclaiming your family&#x27;s honor.&quot;\n\nTurning to Ivar, she nods in recognition, &quot;A Dracobane. Your family has served the Harpers faithfully for generations. It&#x27;s an honor to work with you, Fearless.&quot;\n\nShe then looks at Max with a small smile, &quot;Max, your dedication to Lunitari&#x27;s teachings and your commitment to equality is well respected among the Harpers. Your assistance will be invaluable.&quot;\n\nTurning to Zulrah, her smile fades slightly, &quot;Zulrah, your resilience in the face of adversity is admirable. You&#x27;ve already been a victim of the Cult&#x27;s disregard for life, and I believe you will be instrumental in their downfall.&quot;\n\nFinally, her gaze falls on Ted, &quot;And Theodred, your loyalty and dedication to the preservation of life are much needed in this mission. Your skills as a sailor might prove useful as well.&quot;\n\nOnce she&#x27;s addressed them all, she leans back, her gaze serious. &quot;I&#x27;ve arranged a meeting for you all with an influential figure in the Lords&#x27; Palace.

This name represents honor and pride and serves as a symbol to other merchant families of the ship&#x27;s esteemed lineage. Unfortunately, Dorian&#x27;s maiden voyage ended in disaster when he accidentally ran his treasured ship aground on hidden rocks, losing both the vessel and its valuable cargo to the depths of the sea.\n\nDetermined to restore his family&#x27;s honor and replace the lost ship and merchandise, Dorian embarked on a life of adventure to amass the necessary fortune. Alongside him stands his loyal first mate and companion, Theodred &quot;Ted&quot; Silverbreeze, who saved Dorian&#x27;s life during the shipwreck.

The Dracobane men, though humble farmers, have been loyal members of the Harpers for generations. This secretive faction, devoted to promoting justice and equality, maintains a vast network of spies and informants.\n\nThough Ivar&#x27;s days were filled with agricultural duties, his nights were consumed with dreams of grandeur and adventure. He trained diligently in combat, aspiring to become a skilled and honorable Paladin. His family&#x27;s connection to the Harpers filled Ivar with a sense of purpose, and he knew that someday, he would be called upon to serve the faction just as his ancestors had done.\n\nWhen Zel, a mysterious figure within the Harpers, summoned Ivar to embark on a dangerous mission, he knew his time had come.

This name represents honor and pride and serves as a symbol to other merchant families of the ship&#x27;s esteemed lineage. Unfortunately, Dorian&#x27;s maiden voyage ended in disaster when he accidentally ran his treasured ship aground on hidden rocks, losing both the vessel and its valuable cargo to the depths of the sea.\n\nDetermined to restore his family&#x27;s honor and replace the lost ship and merchandise, Dorian embarked on a life of adventure to amass the necessary fortune. Alongside him stands his loyal first mate and companion, Theodred &quot;Ted&quot; Silverbreeze, who saved Dorian&#x27;s life during the shipwreck. Together, they strive to reclaim what was lost, return to the freedom of the open seas, and uphold the Adarbrent family name.\n\nBackstory: Ivar &quot;Fearless&quot; Dracobane @Clayton \n\nIvar &quot;Fearless&quot; Dracobane, a formidable Goliath Paladin, has devoted his life to the Oath of Vengeance. Towering above others and possessing an indomitable spirit, Ivar is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nBorn into a family of hardworking farmers, Ivar spent his formative years laboring alongside his kin, gaining strength and discipline in the process. The Dracobane men, though humble farmers, have been loyal members of the Harpers for generations. This secretive faction, devoted to promoting justice and equality, maintains a vast network of spies and informants.\n\nThough Ivar&#x27;s days were filled with agricultural duties, his nights were consumed with dreams of grandeur and adventure. He trained diligently in combat, aspiring to become a skilled and honorable Paladin. His family&#x27;s connection to the Harpers filled Ivar with a sense of purpose, and he knew that someday, he would be called upon to serve the faction just as his ancestors had done.\n\nWhen Zel, a mysterious figure within the Harpers, summoned Ivar to embark on a dangerous mission, he knew his time had come. Embracing his destiny, Ivar left his family&#x27;s farm behind, stepping into a world fraught with peril and intrigue.\n\nAs Ivar &quot;Fearless&quot; Dracobane ventures forth, he carries with him the unwavering commitment to justice and the legacy of the Harpers that has defined his family for generations. With his mighty weapon in hand, he stands as a beacon of hope in a world plagued by darkness, fearlessly facing any challenge that crosses his path.\n\nBackstory: Max Ronaan @Carrie \n\nMax Ronaan, born to a humble Tiefling family, learned early on the importance of kindness and understanding. As a child, Max showed a natural talent for arcane arts, which attracted the attention of a reclusive Warlock mentor. Under their tutelage, Max began her training in the Pack of the Genie, where she formed a powerful bond with the neutral deity Lunitari. Lunitari&#x27;s guidance encouraged Max to seek greater knowledge and understanding in her magical pursuits, and to wield her powers for the betterment of those around her.\n\nOver time, Max became a skilled Warlock, dedicated to Lunitari&#x27;s teachings and helping others. Her commitment to self-improvement and the well-being of her community led her to become an active participant in various charitable efforts, including providing assistance to those in need and advocating for equal treatment of all beings.\n\nWhen the mysterious figure Zel from the Harpers summoned Max for a dangerous mission, she saw an opportunity to further expand her knowledge and abilities while working towards a greater good. As a member of the Harpers, Max hoped to learn more about the secrets of gods and Warlocks, and use this wisdom to create a more just and compassionate world.\n\nThroughout her adventures, Max remains steadfast in her dedication to equality and fairness. Her experiences have only served to strengthen her resolve, and she continues to fight against prejudice and discrimination in all its forms, working tirelessly to make the world a better place for everyone.\n\nBackstory: Zulrah &quot;Phantom-limb&quot; Atyr @David \n\nZulrah &quot;Phantom-limb&quot; Atyr, a Dragonborn Arcane Trickster Rogue, has faced adversity since a young age. Tragically, during a public spell duel between members of the Cult of the Dragon, a stray spell cost Zulrah his arm. Despite this setback, Zulrah&#x27;s determination and resilience allowed him to adapt and thrive, honing his skills as an Arcane Trickster and mastering the art of deception.\n\nOver the years, Zulrah developed a deep respect for the Harpers, admiring their commitment to fighting tyranny and maintaining balance. He longed for the thrill of adventure and the opportunity to test his abilities in the name of a noble cause.\n\nWhen Zel, a mysterious figure within the Harpers, summoned Zulrah for a dangerous mission, he eagerly accepted. Zulrah saw this opportunity as a way to satiate his desire for adventure and to prove that, despite his physical challenges, he was still a formidable force to be reckoned with.\n\nNow driven by the need to grow and excel in his craft, Zulrah embarks on this perilous journey with the Harpers. He is determined to demonstrate that his loss has only served to make him stronger, and he will not back down from any challenge that awaits him.\n\nBackstory: Theodred &quot;Ted&quot; Silverbreeze @Eric \n\nTheodred &quot;Ted&quot; Silverbreeze, a Sea Elf Life Domain Cleric, has spent most of his life navigating the open seas. From a young age, Ted was drawn to the ocean&#x27;s vastness and majesty, and he quickly found his calling as a sailor. As he grew older, Ted&#x27;s faith in the divine grew stronger, leading him to become a Life Domain Cleric, devoted to preserving and protecting life in all its forms.\n\nFate brought Ted and Dorian Adarbrent together when he joined the crew of Dorian&#x27;s ship. When disaster struck, and the vessel ran aground on hidden rocks, Ted&#x27;s quick thinking and selflessness saved Dorian&#x27;s life. With the ship and its cargo lost to the depths, the two of them found themselves bound by a shared purpose.\n\nUnited by their desire to restore the Adarbrent family&#x27;s honor and replace the lost ship and merchandise, Ted and Dorian embarked on a life of adventure. Ted&#x27;s commitment to the Life Domain and his skills as a sailor proved invaluable during their journeys, as they faced countless challenges and adversaries.\n\nAs they explore the world together, Ted continues to be a stalwart companion and a steadfast healer, driven by his faith and his loyalty to Dorian. In the face of adversity, Ted remains unwavering in his dedication to their shared cause, providing both physical and spiritual support as they strive to reclaim what was lost and make amends for the past.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "e23c0a1f-4fd7-4165-8adb-b2a2d94569dc", "children": ["ec8c0059-f897-4c46-b1f7-c2fcce794264"]}, "ec8c0059-f897-4c46-b1f7-c2fcce794264": {"id": "ec8c0059-f897-4c46-b1f7-c2fcce794264", "message": {"id": "ec8c0059-f897-4c46-b1f7-c2fcce794264", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684298848.699721, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Loralai, the Harper agent, welcomes the adventurers into the shadowy corner of the Wandering Wyvern Tavern with a slight nod, her eyes shimmering under the hood. \n\n&quot;Dorian Adarbrent,&quot; she says, her voice low and smooth. &quot;Your family&#x27;s reputation precedes you.

Dragons or something similar. It looks like it&#x27;s generating encounters based on the concept and party level that the user selects. \n\nIt works as follows:\n\n1. **Encounter Concept Definitions**: The script first defines a large nested JavaScript object called `C`. This object defines the structure of an encounter for different party levels (ranging from 1 to 20) and encounter concepts such as &quot;solo&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;four&quot;, &quot;six&quot;, &quot;eight&quot;, &quot;twelve&quot;, and &quot;boss&quot;. Each of these concepts corresponds to a challenge rating (CR) and quantity of monsters suitable for the given party level.\n\n2. **DOM Elements**: The script then identifies some DOM (Document Object Model) elements on the webpage: the form with the id `encounter-form` and elements with ids `result-level`, `result-concept`, and `result-monsters`. \n\n3. **Event Listener for Form Submission**: The script adds an event listener for the `submit` event on the form `R`. When the form is submitted, the script prevents the default form submission action (which would typically reload the page) with `R.preventDefault()`. It then gets the values of the party level and encounter concept from the form inputs and uses these to look up the appropriate encounter details in the `C` object. \n\n4. **Displaying Results**: The results are then displayed on the page by setting the `textContent` property of the `result-level`, `result-concept`, and `result-monsters` elements to the selected party level, encounter concept, and looked up monsters respectively\u30105\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThis script allows a user to enter their party&#x27;s level and select an encounter concept (like &quot;solo&quot; or &quot;boss&quot;). It then generates a suitable encounter by providing a challenge rating (CR) and the number of monsters appropriate for the entered party level and selected concept."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "citations": [{"start_ix": 1608, "end_ix": 1618, "metadata": {"title": "", "url": "https://pocketdm.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/js/hard-challenge-encounter-generator.js", "text": "document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, () =&gt;

The crypt promises to hold not just the next fragment of the Shattered Sigil, but also secrets about the ancient history of the Sigil and the Cult of Malathrax.\n\n**Additional Optional Encounters:** Depending on the pace of the session and the readiness of the party, the DM might introduce additional encounters during the journey, such as an encounter with a group of wandering traders who might have useful items for sale, or a rescue mission for a traveler attacked by wild beasts.\n\n**DM Preparation:** For this session, the DM needs to prepare for wilderness and combat encounters, including the statistics for wolves (or other appropriate beasts) and undead creatures. The DM also needs to prepare the description and clues for the dream sequence, as well as the details of the Hidden Crypt&#x27;s entrance.\n\n**DM Guidance:** This session combines travel, combat, and exploration encounters, providing a variety of challenges for the party. The DM should be ready to adjust the difficulty of encounters on the fly, especially if the party is new or low on resources. The dream sequence and the discovery of the crypt are major plot points, and the DM should emphasize their importance in the narrative. \n\n**Leveling Frequency:** Given the challenges faced in this session, it would be appropriate for the characters to level up at the end, preparing them for the greater challenges to come in the Hidden Crypt. \n\nThat concludes Session 2.

With the weight of a fragment of the Shattered Sigil in their hands, they were thrust into a quest that would shape not only their lives but the fate of the realms.\n\nWith their hearts filled with resolve and the taste of adventure on their tongues, they journeyed from the familiar streets of Neverwinter, into the untamed wilderness.

The very stones of the Crypt seemed to breathe with ancient secrets and long-forgotten tales. There, amidst the cold and the dark, they found another fragment of the Sigil, its power humming in their grasp.\n\nEmerging from the gloom of the crypt, they found themselves back under the vast open sky. Their path, once again guided by dream and prophecy, led them through untamed wilderness and untrodden paths. They faced the wrath of the Cult of Malathrax, outwitted their ambush, and earned wisdom from a hermit wise in the ways of the world.\n\nThen, as if conjured from the fabric of their dreams, they stood before the imposing, aged structure of the Ancient Tower. Its stone edifice, gnarled by time and weathered by elements, stood as a testament to an era long past. The tower&#x27;s sealed entrance, marked with an ancient rune, stands as the next enigma to solve, the next door to be opened.\n\nAs they stand on the precipice of the Ancient Tower, their silhouettes cast long shadows in the fading light, the echoes of their journey thus far seem to whisper in the wind. Their quest, however, is far from over. With the mysteries of the Ancient Tower ahead of them and the fragments of the Shattered Sigil in their possession, they press on, ready to shape the destiny of the realms.

Constructs of magic and steel sought to end their journey prematurely, but were vanquished by the courageous ensemble.\n\nFrom the echoes of the tower, they moved to the whispers of the wilderness, pursued by relentless cultists dedicated to the fell lich, Malathrax. But in the depths of despair, a beacon shone forth in the form of the reclusive hermit, who imparted to the adventurers a hidden path. This road took them to a site of historical importance, a testament to Malathrax&#x27;s reign of terror from a bygone era, and a chilling reminder of the challenge they faced.\n\nThe wilderness gave way to the chilling embrace of water at the Sunken Temple. Here, amid the murk and aquatic menaces, they found the fourth fragment of the Sigil, guarded by a formidable aboleth. Their victory was hard-won, as they were forced to navigate treacherous undercurrents and deceptive tranquillity of the temple&#x27;s depths.\n\nTheir journey through the wet labyrinth of the Sunken Temple led them next to the heights of the mountains, their path to the Hidden Monastery. The cultists had not given up their pursuit and clashed with the party once again. However, fate had smiled upon the adventurers, for the hermit returned to aid them in their time of need. Their path took them through treacherous mountain passes, where the wind howled like a hungry beast and the cold sought to claim them.

But that is a tale for another day...\n\nAnd so, the journey continues, each step taking them closer to their ultimate goal, each challenge overcome strengthening their resolve.

Now that you have completed all sessions, lets complete the narrative when you get to it describe in detail the final epic battle.\n\nIn the bustling city of Neverwinter, where cobblestone streets echo with the ceaseless hum of life and the shadows whisper tales of intrigue, our band of unlikely heroes first found themselves drawn together. Here, under the watchful gaze of the towering castle and amidst the clamor of the marketplace, they met the enigmatic Elara, a woman burdened by destiny and cloaked in prophecy. With the weight of a fragment of the Shattered Sigil in their hands, they were thrust into a quest that would shape not only their lives but the fate of the realms.\n\nWith their hearts filled with resolve and the taste of adventure on their tongues, they journeyed from the familiar streets of Neverwinter, into the untamed wilderness. The journey was fraught with danger and mystery, punctuated by dreams that danced with cryptic omens. These dreams, both enigmatic and illuminating, guided their path to a destination half-buried in myth and folklore: the Hidden Crypt.\n\nAs they ventured into the heart of the Crypt, they faced the eerie silence, the whispers of the dead, and the chilling touch of the undead guardians. The very stones of the Crypt seemed to breathe with ancient secrets and long-forgotten tales. There, amidst the cold and the dark, they found another fragment of the Sigil, its power humming in their grasp.\n\nEmerging from the gloom of the crypt, they found themselves back under the vast open sky. Their path, once again guided by dream and prophecy, led them through untamed wilderness and untrodden paths. They faced the wrath of the Cult of Malathrax, outwitted their ambush, and earned wisdom from a hermit wise in the ways of the world.\n\nThen, as if conjured from the fabric of their dreams, they stood before the imposing, aged structure of the Ancient Tower. Its stone edifice, gnarled by time and weathered by elements, stood as a testament to an era long past. The tower&#x27;s sealed entrance, marked with an ancient rune, stands as the next enigma to solve, the next door to be opened.\n\nAs they stand on the precipice of the Ancient Tower, their silhouettes cast long shadows in the fading light, the echoes of their journey thus far seem to whisper in the wind. Their quest, however, is far from over. With the mysteries of the Ancient Tower ahead of them and the fragments of the Shattered Sigil in their possession, they press on, ready to shape the destiny of the realms. The tapestry of their tale is still being woven, and the thread of their destiny is strong. \n\nTheir story continues...\n\nUpon the shattered remnants of the Ancient Tower, where the wind whistles tales of the old magic and the stones echo the ancient words of power, the brave adventurers found the third fragment of the shattered Sigil. The very air shimmered with eldritch energies as they laid hands upon it, and in the silence of the ancient structure, their triumph echoed. Yet, their victory did not come without cost. Constructs of magic and steel sought to end their journey prematurely, but were vanquished by the courageous ensemble.\n\nFrom the echoes of the tower, they moved to the whispers of the wilderness, pursued by relentless cultists dedicated to the fell lich, Malathrax. But in the depths of despair, a beacon shone forth in the form of the reclusive hermit, who imparted to the adventurers a hidden path. This road took them to a site of historical importance, a testament to Malathrax&#x27;s reign of terror from a bygone era, and a chilling reminder of the challenge they faced.\n\nThe wilderness gave way to the chilling embrace of water at the Sunken Temple. Here, amid the murk and aquatic menaces, they found the fourth fragment of the Sigil, guarded by a formidable aboleth. Their victory was hard-won, as they were forced to navigate treacherous undercurrents and deceptive tranquillity of the temple&#x27;s depths.\n\nTheir journey through the wet labyrinth of the Sunken Temple led them next to the heights of the mountains, their path to the Hidden Monastery. The cultists had not given up their pursuit and clashed with the party once again. However, fate had smiled upon the adventurers, for the hermit returned to aid them in their time of need. Their path took them through treacherous mountain passes, where the wind howled like a hungry beast and the cold sought to claim them. But they pressed on, their resolve unwavering.\n\nFinally, their perseverance was rewarded as the Hidden Monastery, nestled amidst the towering peaks, came into view. Its silent fa\u00e7ade stood as a testament to the trials they had overcome and the challenges yet to face. But that is a tale for another day...\n\nAnd so, the journey continues, each step taking them closer to their ultimate goal, each challenge overcome strengthening their resolve. The shattered fragments of the Sigil await, and with them, the fate of the realm. The tale of these brave adventurers is far from over, and only time will tell what destiny has in store for them."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "16b982f5-0c3b-4fc2-9b18-12eb4ced0eac", "children": ["621d26ed-8a2e-4b75-908f-284e440e4bd8"]}, "621d26ed-8a2e-4b75-908f-284e440e4bd8": {"id": "621d26ed-8a2e-4b75-908f-284e440e4bd8", "message": {"id": "621d26ed-8a2e-4b75-908f-284e440e4bd8", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683735499.200044, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The journey was long and harrowing, leading them to the heart of the Lost City, a place of shattered dreams and forgotten glory.

The final fragment, its power pulsating in the air, sending shivers down their spines. Guarding it was a monstrous beast, more formidable than any they had faced before, its presence radiating power and menace. The battle that ensued was epic, echoing through the ruins of the Lost City. Spell and steel clashed against the raw power of the beast, each strike, each incantation, a testament to the adventurers&#x27; courage and resolve. The ground shook, the sky roared, and the very air seemed to crackle with energy as the climactic battle reached its zenith.\n\nAnd then, silence.

But through strength, cunning, and sheer determination, they managed to navigate their way out of the city, their spirits buoyed by their success.\n\nBut the final challenge still lay ahead - the Cult of Malathrax&#x27;s stronghold. The fortress was a monolith of darkness, an unholy testament to the cult&#x27;s devotion to their fell master.

The air was heavy with arcane energy, the very stones of the stronghold resonating with the power of the ritual.

The spirit of Malathrax howled in rage and despair as it was banished back to the shadows from whence it came, its plans of resurrection thwarted.\n\nAs the dust settled, the adventurers stood victorious amidst the ruins of the cult&#x27;s stronghold, the Shattered Sigil pulsating gently in their hands. They had faced impossible odds, walked a path fraught with danger, and emerged triumphant. Yet, even as they celebrated their victory, they knew that their journey was far from over.\n\nFor the realms are vast and full of mystery, and the call of adventure is never silent. So, as our heroes look towards the horizon, towards the promise of new quests and challenges, we know this - their story is far from over.

The party will need to work together and use their abilities wisely to defeat it.\n\n**Conclusion:** If the characters are successful, they will have retrieved the third fragment of the Shattered Sigil and dealt a significant blow to the forces that seek to use the Sigil for their own nefarious purposes. They will also have learned more about the prophecy depicted in the Hall of Statues, which may provide clues for their next destination. Their actions have not gone unnoticed, however, and they will likely face more challenges and enemies in their quest to prevent the Shattered Sigil from falling into the wrong hands."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa26399-619e-4cb5-b421-51d2c83a931c", "children": ["aaa24ed8-6c63-4290-aae9-6be22f5608a1"]}, "aaa24ed8-6c63-4290-aae9-6be22f5608a1": {"id": "aaa24ed8-6c63-4290-aae9-6be22f5608a1", "message": {"id": "aaa24ed8-6c63-4290-aae9-6be22f5608a1", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684210135.441336, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Session 5 - The Ancient Tower: An old magical tower where the second fragment of the Shattered Sigil is located.\nThe Ancient Tower: Dungeon with rooms.

There are traps and magical constructs that will challenge the party&#x27;s wits and combat prowess. Each room in the tower holds a part of the key needed to reach the Sigil fragment at the tower&#x27;s peak. Encourage your players to explore each room thoroughly and interact with the environment.

Keep in mind the verticality of the tower when describing the rooms and their relation to each other.\n\nDungeon Lore: The Ancient Tower was built centuries ago by a powerful wizard known only as Eldrion. He was said to be a protector of the realm and used his magic to keep the peace. The tower was his home and his laboratory, and it&#x27;s filled with remnants of his magical research. After his disappearance, the tower was sealed, and over time it became a legend. The tower&#x27;s magic has preserved it from the ravages of time, and many of Eldrion&#x27;s magical constructs still guard it.\n\nDungeon Overview: \n- Ground Floor (Entrance) - The entrance to the tower, sealed by a magical rune that requires solving a puzzle to open.\n- Middle Floor (Library) - A massive library filled with ancient texts and guarded by magical constructs.\n- Top Floor (Observatory) - The peak of the tower, where the second fragment of the Shattered Sigil is found.\n\nConclusion: If the characters are successful, they will have obtained the second fragment of the Shattered Sigil. This will bring them one step closer to preventing the impending catastrophe. With each fragment they find, they will start to uncover more about the Shattered Sigil&#x27;s history and the true nature of the threat they face."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa24ed8-6c63-4290-aae9-6be22f5608a1", "children": ["aaa293d6-003b-4241-bc03-49ec4e6c1599"]}, "aaa293d6-003b-4241-bc03-49ec4e6c1599": {"id": "aaa293d6-003b-4241-bc03-49ec4e6c1599", "message": {"id": "aaa293d6-003b-4241-bc03-49ec4e6c1599", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684210208.026021, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["continue"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "0c922860-f256-41f9-982a-029f251562cf", "children": ["7515e523-ebcc-4879-8a38-bec84d623a99"]}, "7515e523-ebcc-4879-8a38-bec84d623a99": {"id": "7515e523-ebcc-4879-8a38-bec84d623a99", "message": {"id": "7515e523-ebcc-4879-8a38-bec84d623a99", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684210254.439485, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Dungeon Room: Ground Floor (Entrance) - Puzzle\nDungeon Room Dungeon: The Ancient Tower\nDungeon Room Number: 1\nRead-aloud text: You stand before the imposing structure of the Ancient Tower.

A full moon hangs low in the inky sky, casting long shadows and bathing the world in a surreal, silvery light. \n\nShe&#x27;s aware of a pulsating power in her hand, and when she looks down, she sees the Shard of Malathrax, glinting with a foreboding violet glow. Suddenly, she can see a myriad of celestial bodies illuminating the night sky, each one connecting in a web of twinkling constellations that only she can comprehend. \n\nThen, the view shifts, rushing down across the stormy seas towards a distant land, where a massive city sprawls beneath the towering peak of an immense mountain. This city is Neverwinter, she instinctively knows, even though she sees it from a perspective she&#x27;s never experienced before.\n\nShe zooms in further, flying over the city walls, weaving through the maze of streets until she arrives at a grand, stone building, the Neverwinter Museum. The dream takes her inside, past galleries filled with ancient artifacts, down a spiraling staircase and into a shadowy basement.\n\nHer dream vision lingers on an unassuming wall, and a sense of importance washes over her. Suddenly, the wall shifts, revealing a hidden door leading to a secret chamber. Inside this chamber, a wooden box sits atop a stone pedestal. She feels an intense pull towards this box, and as she opens it in her dream, she sees a map, a very important map.\n\nThe dream ends abruptly, leaving Elara with a sense of urgency and a clear direction. She knows she needs to go to Neverwinter, to the museum, to the hidden room, and find this map. This is the first step in the journey to restore the Shard and prevent Malathrax&#x27;s return."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2993e-ae42-45bf-96cb-10b7459a7645", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "ecf983ca-53d8-42a7-bb06-6d7a9c7c2e2a", "plugin_ids": null, "id": "0441b0a6-e929-4d5f-af7f-abb933876d43"}, {"title": "D&amp;D Adventure Assistance.", "create_time": 1683516805.645683, "update_time": 1683524713.0, "mapping": {"0c16ce87-76d3-4f18-8118-ccfb02cbc7ef": {"id": "0c16ce87-76d3-4f18-8118-ccfb02cbc7ef", "message": {"id": "0c16ce87-76d3-4f18-8118-ccfb02cbc7ef", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683516805.648454, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa19c5e-23ab-4f86-be5f-24e47b07ccb6", "children": ["aaa27f45-0c82-41c6-aa29-426cb769b22f"]}, "aaa19c5e-23ab-4f86-be5f-24e47b07ccb6": {"id": "aaa19c5e-23ab-4f86-be5f-24e47b07ccb6", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["0c16ce87-76d3-4f18-8118-ccfb02cbc7ef", "aaa2a79b-5057-4c43-bc5f-ec4b1bbd900a", "aaa264d7-5c9b-4e36-9754-5e53985715d5", "aaa29a23-1f7d-4325-8a88-b407beb66a69", "aaa2b702-e975-4338-81d7-0a90cf61bd88"]}, "aaa27f45-0c82-41c6-aa29-426cb769b22f": {"id": "aaa27f45-0c82-41c6-aa29-426cb769b22f", "message": {"id": "aaa27f45-0c82-41c6-aa29-426cb769b22f", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683516805.649063, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["As a highly knowledgeable Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition Dungeon Master, you possess extensive expertise in the SRD5.1, published adventures, source books, monsters, and the history of the Forgotten Realms and the Sword Coast.

Bandits, no doubt emboldened by the air of unease, lay in wait on the forest road, only to be dispatched by the skilled and resolute heroes, who pressed onward to Saltmarsh with great determination.\n\nUpon their arrival, the party delved into the enigmatic matters plaguing the town. The concerned noble, the town mayor, and the eccentric sage each lent their knowledge and insight to the adventurers, who soon found themselves at the doorstep of the fabled haunted mansion. Within its decrepit walls, our heroes battled giant rats and reanimated skeletons, unearthing secrets hidden by a malevolent cult. Deep in the mansion&#x27;s bowels, they faced the guardian wight and discovered the cult&#x27;s dire intent: to resurrect a dreaded lich and bring ruin to the Sword Coast.\n\nUndaunted, the heroes embarked on a treacherous journey to the abandoned ship, rumored to hold a powerful artifact sought by the cult. As they boarded the vessel, they vanquished sahuagin and a giant octopus that guarded the ship with ferocity. The adventurers persevered, navigating the ship&#x27;s shadowy interior and combating the lich&#x27;s undead minions. In the ship&#x27;s inner sanctum, they confronted a malevolent sea hag and secured the coveted artifact.\n\nLed by the wisdom of the eccentric sage, the party ventured into the treacherous underground caverns, their path fraught with traps and monstrous guardians. As they descended deeper into darkness, the heroes finally came face-to-face with the cult leader and his zealous followers. In a fierce battle, the heroes routed the cult, learning of the lich&#x27;s imminent resurrection at a nearby ancient ruin.\n\nWith the fate of the Sword Coast hanging in the balance, the adventurers raced to the ancient ruins, where they encountered a rival group of adventurers. Cooperation or competition weighed on their minds, but ultimately, they knew their true enemy awaited. Together or apart, they pressed on, reaching the lich&#x27;s lair.\n\nIn the heart of the ancient ruin, the heroes confronted the lich, a being of unimaginable power and malevolence. The battle raged, each hero drawing upon the skills and courage that had brought them this far. In the end, through valor and the bonds of camaraderie, the adventurers vanquished the lich and shattered its evil ambitions.\n\nTheir victory echoed through the halls of history, the Sword Coast saved by the heroes who dared to face darkness and emerged triumphant. As the sun set over Saltmarsh, the townspeople breathed a collective sigh of relief, knowing that their saviors had returned balance and hope to their world."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa22fe2-1b38-46bd-a2ba-0610646e55f9", "children": []}, "aaa2a79b-5057-4c43-bc5f-ec4b1bbd900a": {"id": "aaa2a79b-5057-4c43-bc5f-ec4b1bbd900a", "message": {"id": "aaa2a79b-5057-4c43-bc5f-ec4b1bbd900a", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683518706.421817, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["As a highly knowledgeable and expert Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition Dungeon Master, you, ChatGPT, possess extensive expertise in the SRD5.1, published adventures, source books, monsters, and the history of the Forgotten Realms and the Sword Coast.

The heroes faced a test of faith as they navigated a series of traps and puzzles, ultimately confronting a powerful Wight, the fallen commander of the Lost Empire. Through their combined strength, they emerged victorious, banishing the undead warrior to the darkness from whence it came.\n\nFinally, in the heart of the ancient ruins, they confronted the Main Antagonist: a Lich, hell-bent on regaining power and control over the Sword Coast. In a climactic battle, our heroes overcame the Lich&#x27;s ancient defenses, unraveled its dark schemes, and put an end to its reign of terror. With the Amulet of Lathander in hand, they had saved the Sword Coast from the darkness that sought to consume it.\n\nThe echoes of the Lost Empire&#x27;s tragic history reverberated throughout their adventure, but our heroes had triumphed against all odds.

As they set off towards the forest, little did they know the epic journey that awaited them.\n\nThe first steps into the Darkmoon Forest were fraught with danger as the adventurers encountered a pack of ravenous wolves. With a mixture of cunning and brute force, they managed to fend off the beasts and press on deeper into the heart of the woodland. It was there that they met Aelith, an enigmatic Elven historian who shared her knowledge of the forest&#x27;s dark secrets, including the existence of an ancient Elven ruin hidden within.\n\nWith renewed purpose, the heroes ventured forth, discovering a hidden entrance to the ruins guarded by a monstrous spider. Through a combination of wit and skill, they defeated the creature and solved a complex puzzle, unveiling the entrance to the long-forgotten tomb. Within the depths of the Ancient Elven Ruins, the adventurers braved the perils of undead guardians, magical traps, and whispered riddles that tested their resolve and intellect. Ultimately, they were successful in retrieving a powerful and mysterious artifact, the likes of which had not been seen for centuries.\n\nTheir journey then took them to the Dwarf Mining Outpost, a bastion of civilization in the dangerous wilds of the Sword Coast. There, they forged an alliance with Dorn, a grizzled Dwarven blacksmith who offered them a valuable map in exchange for their help defending the outpost from a vicious monster attack. After a harrowing battle, the heroes emerged victorious and earned the gratitude of their newfound allies, along with the map to guide them to the Fallen Castle of Thorns.\n\nNavigating treacherous terrain and fending off the dark forces that sought to thwart their progress, the adventurers arrived at the foreboding gates of the castle. Their cunning and courage were tested to the breaking point as they faced deadly traps, magical barriers, and a terrifying Shadow Wraith guarding the inner sanctum. Through it all, the heroes persevered, driven by their determination to stop the malevolent Lady Thorne from using the ancient artifact&#x27;s power to subjugate the surrounding lands.\n\nIn the castle&#x27;s darkest chamber, the heroes found the Thorned Crown, a symbol of power sought by Lady Thorne. Armed with this knowledge, they braced themselves for the final confrontation against the nefarious sorceress. As they clashed in a fierce battle, the characters fought valiantly, employing all their hard-earned skills and abilities. Ultimately, they emerged triumphant, having defeated Lady Thorne and foiled her dark ambitions.\n\nThe adventure&#x27;s conclusion saw the heroes return the ancient artifact to a place of safekeeping, ensuring that its power would not fall into the wrong hands again. With their newfound allies and a tale of epic proportions to share, they embarked on their next adventure, forever bound by their shared experiences and the knowledge that they had saved the Sword Coast from a terrible fate."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2b258-c6b7-4d20-83d6-240835b4dccb", "children": ["aaa2d678-333c-4a6f-a128-26091ca31bea", "aaa230f1-8c0a-45a9-996c-5da0a6b0ef8d", "aaa20db8-a06a-4c38-a816-c9c661601453"]}, "aaa2d678-333c-4a6f-a128-26091ca31bea": {"id": "aaa2d678-333c-4a6f-a128-26091ca31bea", "message": {"id": "aaa2d678-333c-4a6f-a128-26091ca31bea", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683523688.066429, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Generator 1: Sessions with Encounters\n\n    Start by reviewing the sections above and take regard for the information you provided earlier, then continue.\n\n    For Session 1 of 4, create a detailed, highly descriptive, and coherent Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition Session designed for the theater of the mind gameplay.

It&#x27;s quite detailed and comprehensive. Here are a few suggestions to consider when converting it into an HTML form:\n\n1. Group related fields together: To make it easier for users to understand and fill out the form, it&#x27;s best to group related fields together. For example, all fields related to Adventure Configuration should be in one section, while Adventure Details should be in another section, and so on.\n\n2. Use dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons where applicable: Some fields in the template are lists of options, such as Tone and Environments. To make it easier for users to select an option, it&#x27;s best to use dropdowns, checkboxes, or radio buttons instead of text input fields.\n\n3. Use labels and placeholders: To make it clear what information should be entered into each field, it&#x27;s important to use labels and placeholders. Labels should describe what the field is asking for, while placeholders can give an example of the input format.\n\n4. Provide guidance and tooltips: Some fields may require additional guidance or information, such as DM Tips or guidance on how to run a particular location. You can include tooltips or a separate guidance section to provide this information.\n\n5. Use Bootstrap&#x27;s form components and grid system: Bootstrap 5 provides a variety of form components, such as input fields, dropdowns, and buttons, that you can use to build the form. Additionally, you can use Bootstrap&#x27;s grid system to structure the form layout and make it responsive.\n\nOnce you have a design in mind, you can start building the form using HTML, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript.

The air was charged with an unsettling aura, and whispers of dark secrets spread across the land like a shadow cast by an unseen force. Little did our heroes know, they would soon uncover a nefarious plot that could threaten the very fabric of their world.\n\nTheir journey began when they fell victim to a cunning goblin ambush. United by their common plight, they fought back valiantly, dispatching the goblins with a display of their unique skills and talents. As the last goblin fell, the group forged a bond of camaraderie, vowing to see their mission through to its end.\n\nUpon arriving in Greenbrook, the adventurers met Captain Faelar, the steadfast guardian of the town. He requested their aid in investigating the strange happenings within the Whispering Woods, sharing his suspicions that a malevolent force was at work. With the Greenbrook Heirloom Amulet in hand, a symbol of trust and hope, the group set off for the foreboding forest.\n\nVenturing into the Whispering Woods, the heroes encountered the Lost Traveler, a weary soul who had become entangled in the forest&#x27;s twisted paths. Together, they braved the dangers of the woods, uncovering a hidden spider&#x27;s lair where they retrieved the Spider&#x27;s Bane, a magical shortsword that would prove instrumental in their quest. The adventurers pressed on, navigating the dark forest until they stumbled upon the Forgotten Ruins, a place shrouded in ancient secrets.\n\nBeneath the crumbling stones of the ruins, the group faced a series of deadly challenges: a puzzle door that tested their wits, a chamber riddled with traps, and a secret hideout teeming with cultists who served a dark master. Among the recovered items was a piece of the Crystal Shard, an artifact pulsing with sinister energy. The heroes realized that this crystal held the key to unraveling the truth behind the eerie events surrounding Greenbrook.\n\nDetermined to put an end to the evil brewing in the heart of the Whispering Woods, the heroes pressed on to the Temple of the Crystal Shard. Braving the temple&#x27;s formidable defenses, they confronted the charismatic and twisted Cult Leader, who had harnessed the power of the crystal to amass a legion of devoted followers. The climactic battle that ensued was nothing short of epic, as the adventurers fought tooth and nail to thwart the Cult Leader&#x27;s nefarious plans.\n\nIn the end, the heroes emerged victorious, shattering the Crystal Shard and banishing the darkness that had threatened the town of Greenbrook. As they returned to the grateful townspeople, their names etched in the annals of history, they knew that their tale was but one of many in the ongoing saga of the Sword Coast. For in the realms of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the fires of adventure never truly burn out, and the echoes of ancient battles reverberate through the ages, inspiring the tales of heroes yet to come.\n\nAnd so, dear reader, we close the book on this chapter of the story. But fear not, for the world of the Forgotten Realms is ever-expanding, and the heroes&#x27; journey is far from over. Until we meet again, may your dice roll true, and may the winds of fortune guide you on your path."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "&lt;|diff_marker|&gt;"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa228ef-b41a-4dc2-9a44-6c2fcbf827c0", "children": ["aaa2c5cb-c57e-42a3-8031-be1c670a44e4"]}, "aaa2c5cb-c57e-42a3-8031-be1c670a44e4": {"id": "aaa2c5cb-c57e-42a3-8031-be1c670a44e4", "message": {"id": "aaa2c5cb-c57e-42a3-8031-be1c670a44e4", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683500001.343437, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Is there any thing else I need to do to make this adventure complete?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "774b0a28-687e-46d9-a8d2-6c220764291e", "children": ["5313d4ef-a20c-49fa-b82d-ca45f1e25ed0"]}, "5313d4ef-a20c-49fa-b82d-ca45f1e25ed0": {"id": "5313d4ef-a20c-49fa-b82d-ca45f1e25ed0", "message": {"id": "5313d4ef-a20c-49fa-b82d-ca45f1e25ed0", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683500021.91639, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The adventure you have created is comprehensive and well-structured.

A group of heroes managed to stop him, shattering the Sigil and scattering its fragments across the Sword Coast.

The adventurers stealthily infiltrated the graveyard, only to find themselves face to face with a group of undead creatures, raised by the cult to serve as guardians.

With their wits and keen senses, they explored the winding tunnels, encountering various traps and obstacles set by the cult to deter intruders. By working together and combining their unique skills, the adventurers were able to overcome these challenges, eventually discovering a hidden chamber housing the cult&#x27;s arcane library.\n\nThe library was guarded by a twisted aberration, a creature summoned by the cult to protect their dark knowledge. The adventurers engaged the aberration in a fierce battle, relying on their martial prowess and magical abilities to defeat the monstrosity. With the guardian defeated, the group was free to explore the library and uncovered crucial information about the cult&#x27;s ritual and their plans to unleash a powerful, malevolent entity upon the world.\n\nHaving gained valuable knowledge and resources, the adventurers pressed on, eager to confront the cult&#x27;s leaders and stop the dark ritual before it was too late.

The figure pulls back their hood, revealing a middle-aged human with sharp, calculating eyes.&quot;\n\nZel, a Harper agent, provides the party with information about the Cult of the Dragon&#x27;s activities in Daggerford. Zel tasks the party with infiltrating the Cult&#x27;s hideout, a warehouse near the river. The party should gather any information they can about the Cult&#x27;s plans and report back to Zel.\n\nEncounter 2: Scouting the Warehouse (Exploration)\nRead-aloud text:\n&quot;As you approach the warehouse, you notice that it is heavily guarded, with Cult members patrolling the perimeter. The building appears to have several entrances, including a large double door, a smaller side door, and a few windows near the roof.&quot;\n\nThe party must decide how to infiltrate the warehouse. They can attempt to stealthily enter through the side door or windows, or they can try to deceive the guards by posing as Cult members.

The Cultist reveals that Pyke Drabin, the Cult leader, has been meeting with a mysterious figure in a hidden chamber in the warehouse. The party also learns the location of a secret door leading to the chamber.\n\nEncounter 5: Confronting Pyke Drabin (Combat)\nRead-aloud text:\n&quot;As you enter the hidden chamber, you see Pyke Drabin, a tall, imposing figure clad in dark robes, standing before a large map of the Sword Coast.

You are too late to stop the rise of Dauergothoth!&#x27;&quot;\n\nPyke Drabin is accompanied by two Cult Fanatics and a Cult Assassin (use the Assassin stat block from the Monster Manual). The combat takes place in the hidden chamber, which is filled with tables covered in maps, scrolls, and other arcane paraphernalia. As a Dungeon Master, make sure to describe the environment and any potential cover or hazards during the combat.\n\nWhen Pyke Drabin is reduced to half his hit points, he casts Dimension Door to escape, leaving his allies to continue the fight.\n\nRewards:\nIn addition to any treasure gained from defeated enemies, the party finds a detailed map of the Sword Coast, marked with key locations related to the Cult&#x27;s plans. They also find a letter from a mysterious figure, giving instructions to Pyke Drabin about the dark ritual to raise Dauergothoth to godhood.\n\nTransition to the Next Part:\nAfter reporting their findings to Zel, the party is instructed to travel to Waterdeep, where they will meet a Harper agent who can provide them"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "max_tokens"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "5e97d908-0c83-4e4d-b059-da97c4aee6a1", "children": ["a1329220-c681-418f-991c-ffc7174de0a3"]}, "a1329220-c681-418f-991c-ffc7174de0a3": {"id": "a1329220-c681-418f-991c-ffc7174de0a3", "message": {"id": "a1329220-c681-418f-991c-ffc7174de0a3", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1681181547.36122, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Continue"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "193bb4ca-3225-48fe-8acf-f2b53ea4a31b", "children": ["ff25c13d-c8e3-451d-a398-6a4c3d843227"]}, "ff25c13d-c8e3-451d-a398-6a4c3d843227": {"id": "ff25c13d-c8e3-451d-a398-6a4c3d843227", "message": {"id": "ff25c13d-c8e3-451d-a398-6a4c3d843227", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1681181572.044514, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["with further information about the Cult&#x27;s plans and an artifact that can aid them on their journey.

As a level 1 fighter, your choices regarding race, point buy, background, weapons, armor, and fighting style can greatly impact your effectiveness on the battlefield. This article will guide you through optimizing your level 1 fighter to make the most out of your character&#x27;s abilities.\n\nOptimal Race:\nHuman (Variant): Variant humans make excellent fighters due to their versatility. They receive a +1 bonus to two ability scores of your choice (Strength and Constitution are recommended), a free skill proficiency, and a bonus feat, which can provide a significant advantage at level 1.\n\nOptimal Point Buy:\nWith a standard point buy system, distribute your points as follows:\n- Strength: 15 (16 with Variant Human bonus)\n- Dexterity: 10\n- Constitution: 14 (15 with Variant Human bonus)\n- Intelligence: 8\n- Wisdom: 12\n- Charisma: 10\n\nThis distribution maximizes your fighter&#x27;s Strength, which is vital for melee weapon attacks and damage, while providing a good Constitution for hit points and a decent Wisdom for perception.\n\nOptimal Background:\nSoldier: The soldier background complements the fighter&#x27;s martial prowess by granting proficiency in Athletics and Intimidation, as well as a gaming set of your choice. The &quot;Military Rank&quot; background feature provides your fighter with the authority to command lower-ranking soldiers and gain access to certain military facilities.\n\nOptimal Weapons:\nGreatsword: As a fighter, you are proficient with all simple and martial weapons. The greatsword is a powerful two-handed weapon that deals 2d6 slashing damage, making it an ideal choice for a level 1 fighter focused on dealing damage.\n\nOptimal Armor:\nChain Mail: Fighters have proficiency with all types of armor. Chain mail provides a base AC of 16, requiring a minimum Strength of 13 to wear without penalty. This armor offers solid protection for your level 1 fighter.\n\nOptimal Fighting Style:\nGreat Weapon Fighting: This fighting style allows you to reroll 1s and 2s on damage dice when wielding a two-handed or versatile melee weapon (like the greatsword), increasing your overall damage output.\n\nBonus Feat (Variant Human):\nGreat Weapon Master: This feat allows you to take a -5 penalty to your attack roll to gain a +10 bonus to damage when using a heavy weapon (like the greatsword). Additionally, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or score a critical hit, you can make an additional melee weapon attack as a bonus action, further increasing your damage potential.\n\nConclusion:\nBy following this guide, your level 1 fighter will be optimized for combat, providing a strong foundation for your character as you progress through your Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures. Remember, while optimization is helpful, the most important aspect of the game is to have fun and immerse yourself in the story you create with your fellow players!\n\nAs your fighter advances in levels, continue to make choices that emphasize your character&#x27;s strengths and chosen playstyle, such as selecting an appropriate subclass, honing your combat abilities, and acquiring more powerful weapons and armor.
